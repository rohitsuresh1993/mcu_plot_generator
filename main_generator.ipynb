       "'[a convoy of military humvees drives across the afghanistan desert. in one of them is billionaire weapons developer tony stark (robert downey jr.), riding with soldiers on duty. he is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona and his flamboyant public image. suddenly, the convoy is ambushed by unseen gunmen. the soldiers fight to defend themselves but are quickly killed. tony flees the humvee, taking refuge behind a large rock. moments later, a missile lands nearby and explodes, but not before tony sees the stark industries logo painted on it. a small amount of shrapnel penetrates his body armor and he is thrown backwards, losing consciousness.las vegas, 36 hours earliertony stark is about to receive the apogee award in las vegas. a presentation documents tonys life story: born the son of legendary weapons developer howard stark, tony is a child prodigy who built his first circuit board when he was four years old, his first v8 engine when he was six, and graduated summa cum laude from mit when he was 17. his parents were killed in a car accident in 1991, and when he was 21, he became ceo of stark industries, where he is to this day. colonel james \"rhodey\" rhodes (terrence howard) prepares to present tony the award, but tony is not in attendance. tonys right-hand man (and his fathers former partner) obadiah stane (jeff bridges) accepts the award in tonys stead. rhodey later finds tony partying in a casino. on his way out, a reporter named christine everhart (leslie bibb) approaches stark with some questions regarding the ethics of his weapons business. stark deflects her questions with some swift quips and the two end up spending the night together at tonys oceanfront house in malibu.the next morning, christine is awakened by a voice on a computer monitor. its jarvis (voice: paul bettany), the artificially intelligent program responsible for running tonys house and his research lab. as christine leaves the house, shes greeted by tonys human assistant, virginia \"pepper\" potts (gwyneth paltrow). pepper helps tony catch up on some business before tony heads out to the airport where his plane awaits. in flight, tony talks with rhodey. rhodey is unhappy about tonys lax attitude, and tony tries to get his old friend to relax. before long they are drunk and leering at the flight attendants.tony arrives at a military outpost in afghanistan to demonstrate his companys latest project: the jericho, an advanced super-missile system. after the demonstration, tony gets a phone call from obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well. refusing to ride with rhodey, tony takes off in another humvee where the ambush from the opening of the story takes place.much later, tony regains consciousness in a cave. on his chest is a strange device, crudely connected to a car battery. another captive, dr. ho yinsen (shaun toub), explains that he operated on tony but was unable to remove all of the shrapnel. yinsen created a device -- essentially an electromagnet -- that will keep the remaining fragments from shifting and causing further damage to his heart. the terrorists who captured tony and yinsen enter the room. yinsen translates; they want tony to build them a jericho missile. tony refuses and they torture him by dunking his head in water.hours later, the terrorists, members of a group called the the ten rings, show off a huge stockpile of weapons -- all made by stark industries. tony appears to give in and starts building the missile, but he has other plans. with yinsens steady doctors hands, and using palladium collected from his weapons, tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his companys headquarters. the power output is enough to run starks heart for \"fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes.\" it will also be enough to keep the shrapnel in tonys heart from shifting any further and killing him. yinsen tells tony a little about himself; he lived in an afghani village called gulmira that was attacked by the ten rings. he doesnt know if his family is still alive. he also reveals that hed met tony years before at a conference but tony was so drunk that night he probably doesnt remember him.tony is spurred and seems to have a change of heart. he begins to draw up plans for a weapon system, an armored suit powered by the arc reactor that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. midway through construction, the head of the ten rings, raza (faran tahir), arrives and threatens to torture yinsen, angry because he thinks stark is not working on the jericho as they wanted. tony bargains for yinsens life, saying he makes a good assistant. raza gives them one more day to finish.working furiously overnight, tony completes his project. yinsen straps tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. they set off a bomb inside the cell door as a distraction for the guards as tony powers up his suit. yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. he grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.tony, his suit now fully powered, muscles his way through the cave. the guards try to stop him but his suit easily deflects their weapon fire and he beats them off or kills them. he also fires one of the suits missiles at raza himself, who is flung out of sight by the blast. halfway out of the cavern, stark finds yinsen, mortally wounded. yinsen reveals that this was his plan, sacrificing himself so tony could escape -- yinsens family is already dead and he will now see them again in the afterlife. tony tearfully thanks yinsen for saving him. yinsens last words to stark are not to waste his second chance at life.tony turns his suit on the remaining terrorists, igniting flame-throwers and firing missiles. he destroys their stockpile of weapons, but some of their larger-caliber weaponry begins to damage his suit. he uses a rudimentary jet-pack to launch himself out of the valley. not long after firing, his jet-pack fails and he survives a crash in the desert. stark leaves the suit behind and hikes through the desert until a couple of us helicopters fly overhead. a group of soldiers, led by rhodey, come across tony. rhodey is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.tony is quickly flown back to the united states. upon his arrival at edwards air force base, pepper wants tony to receive medical treatment, but tony says that there are only two things he wants: an american cheeseburger and a company press conference. so tony appears before a group of reporters and, clearly humbled and no longer the arrogant ceo he was before his capture, announces that he intends to shut down stark industries weapons manufacturing division immediately. at the same time, pepper is approached by agent phil coulson (clark gregg) the from strategic homeland intervention, enforcement & logistic division. they want to talk to tony about his capture. pepper schedules an appointment for them.that evening, obadiah stane confronts tony about his actions, furious. obadiah knows that the stock value for their company (and, by extension, their financial status) is going to take a serious drop because of this announcement. tony wants stark industries to move forward with arc reactor technology, but obadiah thinks that the arc reactor is nothing but a publicity stunt. through the conversation, tony ends up revealing his mark i chestpiece to obadiah but refuses to allow the device to be studied for production. stane convinces tony to lie low for a while so the company can sort things out.pepper watches jim cramer deliver a scathing news segment on mad money on the declining value of stark industries when tony asks for her help. hes created an upgraded and much more powerful mini arc reactor, the mark ii chestpiece, but cant install it into his chest without someone to help -- his assisting robot, dummy, tried to insert the arc reactor but failed. pepper accidentally yanks out the cords for the old reactor too soon, putting tony on the verge of cardiac arrest. they manage to complete the process in time. tony tells pepper to destroy the old model since hes not a sentimental person.tony visits rhodes and asks for help with a new private project. rhodey does not agree with tonys approach; he thinks tony is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture and needs time to recover.tony turns to his other best friend -- jarvis -- for help. tonys plan is revealed to be an upgrade to his armored suit (referred to as mark ii; the suit from the terrorist cave was mark i). tony, studying a 3d cgi-mapped image of the mark i, discards many of the components, streamlining the design.meanwhile, raza, having survived his battle with stark, searches the desert, gathering all fragments of the mark i suit that tony left behind.tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armors flight system. since the leg-mounted jets proved too unstable, he creates repulsors for the feet and arm-mounted stabilizers for balance. pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon. in his first test, the repulsor blows him backward. pepper leaves a paper-wrapped box on tonys desk as a gift.obadiah visits tony and reveals that the board of directors has filed an injunction to gain control of stark industries. tony isnt worried; he still maintains controlling interest in stark industries.after several failed and painful attempts, tony perfects his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.the mark ii armored suit is soon finished. it looks like a heavily-streamlined version of tonys mark i armor. tony connects with jarvis to monitor the progress in the suit. against jarviss advice, tony takes it out for a test flight, and he is thrilled by the suits functionality. tony pushes the limit for high-atmosphere flying, but at such great heights the freezing air causes the suit to become coated with ice and his power supply shuts down. tony is barely able to reactivate his thrusters in time to avoid crashing into the ground. stark returns home, but the armor is so heavy that it smashes through three floors of the house and he crushes one of his prized sports cars. as tony recovers from his crash landing, he opens the box that pepper left behind earlier; inside is the mark i arc reactor, encased as a trophy with the message, \"proof that tony stark has a heart.\"tony analyzes more data and decides to rebuild the suit using gold titanium from an old project to solve the icing and weight problems. he instructs jarvis to add some hot-rod red trim to the next suit, codenamed mark iii, then leaves to attend his annual benefit dinner while the new suit is being assembled and painted.at the charity event, tony meets with agent coulson, who still wants to learn about tonys incident. tony leaves to dance with pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.christine, the reporter tony slept with prior to leaving for afghanistan, angrily confronts him, showing him photographs of his weapons being used by a terrorist group the previous day in the remote afghan town of gulmira, yinsens home village. tony confronts obadiah on the matter, and obadiah reveals that he is the one who filed the injunction against tony. obadiah calls himself an \"iron monger,\" and has no qualms about selling stark industries weapons to both sides of the conflict. tony returns home, furious. while there he watches news reports of the worsening situation in the gulmira region. he tests modifications to his hand repulsors, turning them into a weapon and blasting out several glass panes. when the new suit is completed it is fitted to his body by an automated robotic system. stark flies off to gulmira at hypersonic speed, determined to right his companys wrongs.in gulmira, terrorists are rounding up civilians for capture and execution when tony shows up. his mark iii armor is more than a match for them. within seconds, he defeats the first group of terrorists, using his advanced weapons to take out several without any innocent casualties. he leaves the groups leader, razas chief lieutenant, alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.while flying to find his weapons, iron man is shot down by a tank shell. when he gets up, a second shell barely misses him. he responds by shooting a mini-missile at the tank, destroying it. using the palm repulsors he designed, he destroys the captured jericho missiles. after they are demolished, raza arrives in time to see tony fly off.centcom at edwards air force base detects tony in flight, mistaking him for a rogue drone. col. rhodes is asked about the status of any new developments. he contacts tony, who claims that he knows nothing about what is happening. in the meantime, tony is confronted by two f-22 raptors. he tries to outrun the jets but they are too much for him. tony calls rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the \"unidentified craft.\" rhodey is furious about tony sending in unauthorized equipment, and horrified when tony explains that the \"equipment\" is actually himself in his new invention. tony is hit by one fighter jet, sending him flying into the wing of the second jet. the pilot is forced to eject, but his parachute fails to open. iron man, still under fire, flies in and deploys the parachute in time to rescue the pilot. tony convinces rhodey to pass off what happened with the jets as a \"training exercise.\"after tony arrives back at home, pepper catches him removing the battle-damaged mark iii armor. the removal is not going as well as the assembly and tony quips that pepper has seen him in situations that were much worse.meanwhile, stane pays a visit to the ten rings camp. he paid the ten rings members to capture and kill tony, but they realized who tony was and had demanded a much higher price when they made their tape. using a high-powered sonic device that induces temporary paralysis, stane immobilizes raza and takes the remnants of the mark i armor they have gathered. stane then has his men execute everyone in the camp.tony tries to talk pepper into helping him, believing that nothing else matters but saving the people who he put in harms way. pepper is moved by tonys dedication, and agrees. she goes into obadiahs office with a flash drive programmed to copy files from the computer. as pepper sifts through stored files, she finds a video from the terrorists proving that obadiah was responsible for tonys capture. obadiah comes into the office and sees her at the computer, but pepper manages to hide what she is really doing. she leaves the office, but as soon as he powers up the computer, obadiah realizes what she was up to. on the way out, pepper sees agent coulson and tells him he can have his interview immediately so that he accompanies her safely out of the building.obadiah meets with his team of developers who are working on his own armored suit based on the mark i. they have rebuilt the components, but they cannot miniaturize starks arc reactor. stane is furious but relents when the lead developer tells him hes not the genius tony is. obadiah realizes that he has one other option.stane arrives at tonys house and paralyzes him with the sonic weapon. obadiah yanks out the the mark ii chest piece from tonys chest, taunting him about how it will be the flagship invention in a new era of weaponry. after he leaves, tony realizes that he has only one hope for survival -- the preserved arc reactor that pepper gave him as a gift. he staggers down to his workshop and nearly dies while trying to retrieve the reactor, which is handed to him by dummy. tony gets the reactor installed just as rhodey arrives. rhodey informs him that five agents have gone to arrest obadiah, but tony knows that is not nearly enough manpower.rhodey watches tony suit up, awestruck at the iron man armor. rhodey asks if theres anything tony needs, tony asks him to \"keep the skies clear.\" as tony flies away, rhodey spots the silver-colored prototype suit, the mark ii... then shakes his head and mumbles \"next time.\"pepper, coulson and several other agents arrive at obadiahs research facility. they spot the mark i armor and a storage location where something else was kept. just then, a gigantic robotic suit comes to life and attacks them -- its obadiahs counterpart suit, code-named the iron monger, powered by the chest piece he stole from tony.while tony flies towards the research facility, jarvis warns him that he has only about half power in the suit because the older chest piece wasnt designed power the mark iii during sustained flight.tony arrives just as obadiah is about to execute pepper. the two ironclad warriors begin a huge, brawling battle that spills into the streets near stark industries, tony tries to protect any innocent civilians. tony flies into the upper atmosphere, drawing obadiah along with him. obadiah struggles but before long begins to freeze up -- his suit has the same icing problem that tonys mark ii had. obadiah begins to fall back to earth, leaving tony hovering above. the older arc reactor begins to lose power rapidly and tony falls back to earth, landing on top of his factory, running on auxiliary backup power.back on the ground, obadiah attacks tony again. tony evades obadiah long enough to instruct pepper to overload the buildings arc reactor, which will generate a shock wave strong enough to disable obadiahs suit. pepper is hesitant, believing that tony could also be killed. tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor. the reactor releases its shock wave, knocking out the iron monger suit, which falls into the reactor, killing stane and destroying the reactor. starks original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing tony to survive.days later, rhodey holds a press conference about the incident with the two \"robots.\" tony is impressed with the name the newspapers come up with, \"iron man,\" and plans to adopt it. agent coulson has released cover stories about the death of obadiah (who will die in a small plane crash while tony is supposedly elsewhere) and the \"truth\" about iron man (who will be referred to as starks bodyguard). pepper thanks coulson but cannot remember the full name of the group he belongs to. coulson tells them to call it \"s.h.i.e.l.d.\" and says that they will be in touch again.tony goes before the reporters once more, and prepares to comply with the cover story. but, as he begins talking, he throws away his notes and declares \"i am iron man.\" the press goes into a frenzy.much later (after the credits), tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black telling him that as iron man, tony has become part of a larger universe. tony asks who the man is. he turns around and introduces himself: nick fury, director of s.h.i.e.l.d. (samuel l. jackson). hes come to talk with tony about an upcoming project known as the avenger initiative.][over the opening credits, we see how the hulk was born. bruce banner (edward norton) and betty ross (liv tyler) were scientists working on a project involving making the body resistant to certain types of radiation, specifically gamma rays (the most harmful kind, lead sheets required). however, something went wrong, and through banners or the hulks, rather eyes we see him destroying the lab, killing some other scientists, injuring the project overseer, general thaddeus thunderbolt ross (william hurt), and rendering betty rosss daughter, of course unconscious. a little later, we see bruce at the bedside of betty, who is wavering in and out of consciousness, when suddenly ross is there with his arm in a sling, screaming at bruce. bruce flees, and the hunt begins as ross tracks down every possible lead he can find on the location of banner and what lies within him158 days without incidentin a town in brazil, bruce wakes up from a nightmare of everything thats happened to him. he groans and goes about his morning routine, which includes feeding his dog rick and learning portuguese by watching sesame street and comparing what he hears to a portuguese-english dictionary. he also spends time learning relaxation techniques in an effort to control his heart-rate and keep himself from becoming too excited. he goes to his job as a day laborer at a local factory, handing out dry goods and cleaning up messes while avoiding the old tough guys at a bottling factory. he also occasionally helps out with the electrical aspects when something breaks, which it does today. as hes fixing it and joking around with the manager, he cuts himself on a metal clip and the blood falls through all the grated floors onto the belt, and bruce freaks out, yelling for the belt to stop. confused, the workers stop the belt and bruce inspects the area where the blood fell, cleaning it up and giving it the okay. as the belt starts and people start talking about the crazy gringo, no one notices the drop of blood that fell into a bottle currently destined for the united states of america.unaware of the contaminated bottle, bruce starts to leave, but notices the same toughs who usually give him a hard time coming on to an attractive co-worker, martina. bruce stops the action by asking martina if shed like to have lunch with him tomorrow, but the leader of the gang starts coming up to bruce, who cautions him in portuguese by saying, dont make me hungry. you wouldnt like me when im hungry. confused, bruce goes over this just as the manager pops up, enabling him to escape a beating and head for home, stopping along the way to pick up a package from someone. once there, bruce boots up his homemade computer and makes contact with someone named mr. blue in america. together, the two of them are working on a cure to bruces little problem, and after dicing up the package a flower and applying its juice to his blood, bruce regretfully types, no change, to which blue types that he should come to new york and get more date contamination levels, exposure rates, types and amounts of radiation, the works. he glances at a photo of betty he keeps before regretfully saying that he cant do that either and powering down for the night.meanwhile, at the pentagon, ross is receiving a report from his chief assistant, major kathleen sparr (christina cabot) that an old man in ohio died after received gamma poisoning from his fruit drink that came from brazil (note the man is stan lee, marvel creator). ross quickly orders a team down there the next day, put together with no small amount of efficiency by his old army friend general joseph greller (peter mensah). the team is headed up by the russian-born but america-trained emil blonsky (tim roth). ross informs them all that their target is a scientist who has stolen military secrets and that he will definitely be a fighter if cornered. as they fly down to brazil, bruce gets a message from blue saying that he may have success, but needs bruces blood to be sure, which bruce reluctantly -- and carefully -- sends off to him. that night, bruce is sleeping soundly when rick starts barking. meanwhile, the commandos have taken up position outside and are scanning the room with a camera, which rick promptly eats (or tries to). disgusted, the commandos blow off the door and after tranqing the dog, fire a dozen tranquilizers at a sleeping banner. they whip the covers off and see that its just pillows. they hit the street after finding a rope, getting a little ahead of bruce, who is hiding in the apartment of martina just below him. after giving them a few minutes, bruce hits the ground but is immediately spotted by blonsky. he breaks for it, going across rooftops and up the sides of buildings, at one point narrowly missing running right into a too-shocked-to-move rosss arms. as hes running, he manages to crash into some people that turn out to be the gang from the factory. they join in on the chase, and bruce ducks into the factory to lose them all, but unfortunately the gang sees the chain swinging and the troops see the gang. the gang catches up with bruce and start pummeling him, ripping off his backpack and tossing it aside as he begs them to stop before his heart-rate gets too high, getting out in portuguese, \"me....angry....very bad...\" the leader laughs and moves in for the kill while the troops near the fight, but suddenly bruces eyes flash green just as a dart hits one of the toughs. they blame bruce and start in again, but suddenly the leader is thrown a hundred feet through walls and the other men are screaming. the troops cant make out whats happening, but ross hears the audio feed and begins yelling at them to shoot, go live, do something! they switch to live rounds as the last of the gangers is finished and the creature turns to leave, smashing his way out with a big vat of something. the troops open fire, but the bullets just bounce off of him like plastic. the creature roars and starts in on them as blonsky tries to get in a higher position for a better view and shot. he finds it just as the last soldier is finished. he takes his shot, and the creature notices him. a shadow passes, and suddenly blonsky is face-to-face with the hulk. hulk picks up another vat and slams it down, and blonsky goes flying as hulk heads for the jungle, pausing only to give a victory roar. hours later, ross and sparr are going through banners apartment and computer when blonsky comes in, demanding an explanation for what he saw out there. ross just says that he did a good job, and he should tell his men to pack up, since theyre leaving town1 day without incidentbruce wakes up beside a waterfall, not quite sure where he is, his pants hanging off of him and torn. he hears a truck and heads for the road, where the driver tells him hes in guatemala. the driver takes bruce into town, where bruce proceeds to work his way north and pick up some new clothing while in mexico. meanwhile, blonsky has finally succeeded in wearing down ross enough to tell him what went on. ross explains that back in world war ii, there were a lot of special programs being worked on to give america the edge, almost all of them under an infantry weapons development program. one of them was a program for bio-tech force enhancment, more commonly known as \"super soldier\". about five years ago, ross dusted off that program and began trying to put it together again. he recruited banner and his team to work on it, but then something went very wrong....or very right, depending on how you look at it. in either case, the end result, according to ross, is that bruce banners whole body is now, in his opinion, the exclusive property of the u.s. government. the two men sit there and after an exchange about how theyre both fighters, blonsky says that if he could put what he knows now in his body twenty years ago, that would be someone he wouldnt want to fight. ross smiles grimly and says, \"i could probably arrange something like that.\" blonsky merely stares up at him, intrigued.17 days without incident at culver university in virginia, we see bruce heading for the old science department where hulk was born. however, the appearance of security guards checking ids puts the kibosh on those plans. deterred, he heads outside and sees the building housing all science teachers, and who should come out but betty, chatting amiably with a friend of hers. he stares at her stupidly as she eats outside, and she looks up towards him and smiles. he ducks behind a tree (yeah, thatll work), but she was actually smiling at her newly arrived boyfriend, leonard samson (ty burrel), psychologist extraordinaire. now deterred and defeated, he heads to an old on-campus pizza parlor where the owner, stanley (paul soles), is an old friend of his. bruce asks about samson (insert envy joke here), and then asks for two more things -- a place to stay for a few days, and a job. the very next day we see him delivering pizzas in his old uniform, and one of the stops happens to be the science lab. he talks to the guard (lou ferrigno, hulk from the tv series) and is able to get upstairs, where after bribing the head computer genius with a pizza he gets on one of the computers to look for the data on his experiment, but its all gone. bruce contacts blue and tells him the bad news, and then gets out of there.that night, bruce is getting ready to leave and stanley is getting ready to close up when two final customers come in.....betty and samson. they begin chatting with stanley as an unaware bruce comes down the stairs. just as stan consents to make them a pizza bruce opens the kitchen door and sees betty, who sees him. her mouth opens in shock, but when she looks again bruce has taken off. she runs outside but doesnt see him hiding behind the dumpster, and once back inside she bullies stanley into spilling the truth. a while later, we see bruce walking in the rain on a highway when betty pulls up behind him. he sees her and she runs to him, begging him not to go. soon they are pulling into the house she shares with samson, and she reveals a present she kept for him -- all the data from their experiment on a nice little portable drive. he tells her that he cant stay, but accepts her offer of money and a ride to the bus station the next morning. meanwhile, ross is pulling a serum out of cold storage and prepping blonsky for injection, which he warns will hurt. for his part, blonsky just grits his teeth and tells them to get on with it.the next day, bruce and betty are walking through the college campus to the bus station when betty pauses to fix bruces shirt, making him more fashionable. as she does, he sees a soldier move behind a column of one building and tells her to get as far away from him as she can. he bolts and as the soldiers move in, she looks around for the command vehicle and convinces ross to come out, begging for him to stop. he ignores her request and orders the rest of the team in. bruce ducks into a library and removes his pack. he fishes out the drive and forces it down his throat before moving on. however, the pause has caused the soldiers to catch up to him, and they trap him in an overpass as blonsky moves in. they fire two canisters of knockout gas into the bridge, but banner transforms and leaps out. he begins fighting the soldiers, leaping all around them and crushing their vehicles, but blonsky moves in and leaps around hulk like a mosquito, peppering him with rounds from a grenade launcher. he gets hulk to follow him into the path of two sonic blasters which pepper hulk with soundwaves, but unfortunately, hulk sees betty crying out and manages to take them apart using two parts of a nearby sculpture. blonsky gets pissed and approaches hulk, and proceeds to get slammed into a tree breaking every bone in his body. ross orders in a helicopter just as betty runs towards hulk. hulk throws part of the statue at the chipper, which crashes and makes a huge inferno that envelops hulk, who envelops betty and keeps her safe from it, though she does go unconscious again. hulk looks at betty and sees ross standing there with sparr. he snarls at ross, turns, and heads off. later, we see rosss boys taking everything betty owned out of her house as ross tells samson that he did the right thing by calling ross. in turn, samson calls ross the bigger threat, since hulk protected betty whereas ross endangered her. ross says that her safety is his utmost concern, but samson says that his best feature is that he always knows when someone is lying, and that he also knows now why betty never talked about him.that night, in the north carolina stretch of great smoky mountains national park, betty wakes up in a cave to the sound of a thunderstorm. she sees hulk staring down at her curiously and screams. he jumps and hits his head on the ceiling of the cave, but she calms him down. suddenly, lightning strikes and hulk screams at it, throwing a rock into the sky at this new challenger. betty again calms him down, reassuring him as a mother would her frightened child, and eventually he goes to sleep. the next morning, she and bruce wake up and drive into town, where betty gets them a motel room and bruce takes a shower and coughs up the data chip. betty gets him some new clothes and together they get a used car with cash obtained from the pawning of her mothers old necklace. as shes paying, though, bruce uses a public computer to send the data to mr. blue, aka samuel sterns, at his empire state university email address. even worse, rosss team, with the help of the strategic homeland infiltration, enforcement, and logistics division (shield), is able to capture this email and figure out where theyre heading.....empire state university. meanwhile, ross is checking on blonsky, who had previously had more broken bits than the titanic, and is shocked when sparr shows him a fully-healed blonsky, who is \"pissed off and ready for round three.\"back with betty and bruce, we see them heading for new york when betty asks what its like when he changes. the best bruce can answer is that everything is a lot more amplified. betty points out that theres still something of him in there, using the recognition of her as evidence, so maybe if bruce could control it -- but bruce interrupts her, saying that he wants to get rid of it. the next day, the pair are in line at the verrazano-narrows bridge when bruce notices a police checkpoint. they get out, sneak around back of the truck, and head down to the docks, where after one boat ride they find themselves in the city and get a cab to esu, which turns out to be the most frightening ride ever and has betty screaming obscenities at the lascividious cabbie. as he pulls away, our pair have this exchange:bruce: \"you know, i could show you some techniques to manage that rage a little better...\"nbetty: \"dont start!\"eventually, the pair get to esu (with no cabbie murders) and meet the small, quiet, and unassuming young man known as samuel sterns (tim blake nelson). being thrilled to meet both of them, he brings them up to his lab and they immediately start talking, where he warns that if they miscalculate too high, the dose could kill bruce. in turn, bruce warns that if the dose is too low, it could be dangerous to sterns, though sterns just laughs this off, clearly not believing him (though who could, really?). regardless, they set about recreating the experiment with little trouble (student-used computers at fault). they manage to draw hulk out and inject the antidote as betty struggles to keep hulk from lashing out. the antidote takes effect, and hulk reverts back to a hyperventilating bruce. meanwhile, on a military base, we see soldiers prepping for moving out while in a locker room, blonsky examines himself in a mirror. unnoticed, his spines elongates and extends out from his body the slightest bit. he boards the chopper and ross asks him how he feels, and he declares, \"like a monster.\"in the lab, sterns is proposing his latest theory that what they injected bruce with was just for the suppression of that one episode. he starts to talk about his subjects, which causes betty and bruce to stare at him in horror and ask, \"what subjects?\" he smiles gleefully and shows them a room with tons of distorted fetuses and dozens of synthesized bags of bruces blood, all of which sterns was able to make from that one sample bruce sent. bruce and betty tell him that they need to destroy all of it, but sterns can only see a future nobel prize. bruce starts to become agitated, but a sniper suddenly tags him from outside just as blonsky rushes in and knocks him out, shoving betty aside roughly. a team takes bruce out as sparr stays behind to supervise cleanup, but as they do and as betty storms onto a waiting chopper and away from the man she no longer wants to call her father, ross whispers to bruce just before he gets loaded on, \"if you took it from me ill put you in a hole for the rest of your natural life.\"back on the ground, sparr is interrogating sterns when she gets knocked out from behind by blonsky. sterns is terrified, but then blonsky says that he wants sterns to turn him into what bruce turns into. sterns is eager to oblige for reasons that have nothing to do with blonskys threats, but he does warn blonsky that the result, thanks to what blonsky already has in him, could be an abomination. blonsky lifts sterns to the ceiling and says that that counts as informed consent, and the ball starts rolling. as betty and bruce share a moment in the chopper, sterns procedure takes hold, and blonsky -- now the abomination -- smashes the whole lab, spilling chemicals on sterns, whose head bubbles weirdly and begins to grow larger and flatter as he grins. blonsky leaps outside and starts tearing up the streets and soldiers left there, and one of the soldiers gets a message off to ross that, \"the hulk is loose!\" ross glances at banner, who appears just as shocked, and says thats impossible. they manage to get a visual on-screen, and they see the abomination tearing apart the city. bruce realizes that only one thing can stop that and ross agrees. they move over the site and open the back door. betty begs bruce not to do it saying that they dont know if hell change, but he says he has to try. they kiss each other, and then he allows himself to fall backward. he passes the level of buildings, manages to say, \"oh, shi--\"smash!!!a huge hole appears in the middle of the pavement, down the street from the abomination. the hulk slowly pulls himself from the hole, and roars. blonsky hears and grins, and the two monsters run towards each other. they leap and collide in mid air, with blonsky carrying the way, dazing hulk slightly and punching him down the street. hulk shakes it off and tears a police car in two and launches it at the abomination. blonsky takes the hit and then unleashes one of his own, punching hulk through a building and way downtown. the abomination roars in delight and chases after him, climbing up and over buildings to catch up as ross orders the chopper gunner to open fire on blonsky. blonsky barely avoids all of the bullets and catches up to hulk, pummeling him some more before deciding to grab hold of the copter. hulk sees this and then sees betty in there, roars, and grabs hold of blonsky, creating a copter-abomination-hulk chain. the pilot says that its too much weight and he has to put her down while hulk and abomination continue their battle on the landing struts. the battling becomes too much, and the chopper finally crashes near a construction site (always the way...). as betty and ross pull themselves from the wreckage, blonsky keeps beating on hulk. suddenly, a spark from the main rotor hits a gas puddle below the chopper. hulk sees this happening, becomes angrier and bigger, and manages to shove the abomination aside just in time to create a sonic boom that puts out the fire by creating a limited vacuum. meanwhile, the abomination has found a huge chain that just happens to have two mace like attachments on the end and is swinging it at hulk merrily. hulk manages to get under it, get a hold of the chain, and wrap it around blonskys neck. he pulls it tight, and blonsky goes unconscious. he pulls it tighter, determined to kill the source of his hurt and pain when betty cries out, \"stop!\" hulk sees her and calms and obeys. the abomination is still out, so hulk tosses him to land at the feet of ross before letting loose with another victory roar. he quiets, and for a moment, all is still. no one moves as the hulk gazes distrustfully at all the little people with loud guns around him when suddenly a second chopper appears with a searchlight blaring. hulk roars in frustration and takes to the roofs again, running off. he reaches the coastline, and...a few days later, we see betty on liberty island, looking sad as she stares up at the big green woman. a beep sounds from her pocket and she pulls out a camera she had gotten while on the run with bruce to see a picture of him not-quite-smiling back at her beneath the words \"low battery\". the camera suddenly powers down, and betty sighs, saddened by the loss of the one proof she had of their time together...31 days without incidentin bella coola, british columbia, we see a shack set up deep in the mountains. inside, we see bruce addressing an envelope to betty. when hes finished, he opens the flap and puts her mothers necklace inside, making sure to not be rough with it. that done, he sits down and meditates, thinking about what everyone told him about control. he closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and opens them again...they are glowing green.on a black screen, we hear general ross saying reload. we find him sitting in an ordinary bar in an ordinary city uniform undone. the bartender refills his drink as the door opens. tony stark (robert downey jr.) enters and sidles up to ross, offering his condolences on failing to capture banner and losing control of blonsky and saying that he did warn ross against pursuing the super soldier program, since it was shut down for a reason. ross sighs and acknowledges stark, saying that he always wears the nicest suits, to which stark smiles and says, touché. stark says that he heard that ross had an interesting problem, and ross responds by saying, well, youd know all about that wouldnt you? not to be outdone, stark follows up with, were putting a little team together. thought you might be interested. finally letting his curiosity override his caution, ross says, whos we?][the movie opens several months after the events in the first iron man movie. we are introduced to a man named ivan vanko. ivans father anton is slowly dying and telling ivan his final wishes. ivan thinks he should have the fame that tony stark is enjoying but anton tells him to \"ignore that garbage.\" all anton can give ivan is his knowledge. ivan takes a blueprint that has his fathers name on it, and also the name of howard stark, tony starks father. ivan then sets about recreating the arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. tony stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the iron man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.six months after the end of the first movie, tony stark has used his iron man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his fathers dream by reopening the \"stark expo\" in queens, ny, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full iron man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. backstage, following his address, tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. after the event, tony and happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands tony a subpoena, summoning him to a senate armed forces committee hearing. tony and happy decide to take a road trip to washington dc in tonys new audi r8.the next morning, during the senate hearing, tonys usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the iron man armor as a weapon. colonel rhodes presents the investigation into the events surrounding iron mans creation, but senator stern, the committee chairman, takes his remarks out of context. with justin hammer of hammer industries present, tony gives a rebuttal showing that he is iron man and will not part with his armor (likening handing himself over as being tantamount to indentured servitude), and proceeds to hack the committees computers to show that various \"attempts\" at copying tonys suit - from iran, north korea, and even hammer itself - are complete failures: north koreas is top heavy and collapses easily, irans crashes into the ground and explodes, while hammers suit turns around 180 degrees at the waist and severs its pilots spine. with his typical swagger, tony still refuses to turn over the iron man armor to the government and walks out of the hearing.back at home, tony is on jarvis analyzing the latest prototypes and developments for the iron man suit, and pepper enters and the two argue about the future of stark industries. tony is telling pepper that hes making more money off the companys common stock than he ever did as ceo. he decides hes had enough of being the ceo and wants to focus solely on developing iron man. he decides to appoint pepper as the new ceo and leaving her stunned. the next day a lovely notary public enters to have tony officially sign the company over to pepper. tony is undergoing fighting training with happy and performs an illegal move on him, getting it confused with mma. the notarys name is natalie rushman, and he has happy give her a boxing lesson, and while looking up her bio, natalie performs a tko on happy, using a takedown that shows theres a great deal more to her than there appears.tony heads to monaco for some much needed r&r. at a pre-reception before the monaco 500, where stark industries is sponsoring a driver, tonys greeted by his favorite \"vanity fair\" reporter christine everheart, who wants pepper for the cover of the next issue which will introduce her as the new stark industries c.e.o. justin hammer also happens to be there. they also greet tesla motors ceo elon musk, who wants a panel at the stark expo to showcase his latest invention. in the bathroom, its learned that the palladium in tonys chest is slowly spreading, and his arc reactor can barely take the punishment. tony decides that hes going to be driving the stark industries car instead of the driver that was pre-selected.stark starts the race, but unbeknownst to him, ivan vanko has joined one of the races pit crews. under his jump suit, vanko wears a harness with two large energy whips powered by the arc reactor hed built after his father died. vanko uses the whips to stage a massive wreck and ambushes tony. as vanko is wrecking havoc on the track, happy and pepper rush to deliver the briefcase happy carries with him to tony. vanko uses his electric whips to completely destroy the rolls royce phantom that happy and pepper are in, and after repeated ramming attempts, pepper finally manages to give tony the briefcase. tony activates the case which is a portable version of the iron man armor. after a furious battle, tony is able to defeat vanko by manually pulling out the arc reactor battery that powers his whips, crushing it after he has jarvis analyze it. the police grab vanko and take him into custody. the entire crowd is stunned at what theyve just witnessed. justin hammer, however, believes that vanko can be put to better use.stark confronts vanko in prison and vanko asks tony what it feels like to be a dead man and that palladium in the chest is a very painful way to die. stark tells vanko that makes two of them.later, hammer breaks vanko out. he slips vanko a meal consisting of chicken and mashed potatoes along with a note telling him to \"enjoy the potatoes.\" vanko and another prisoner are given uniforms with the same identification. vanko immediately kills the prisoner as well as a guard on his way out the door, and sets the explosive device contained in the potatoes and as he makes his escape, hes bagged by two hammer operatives and taken away. hammer knows vanko needs his resources to outdo tony, and vanko obliges. hammer then hires vanko to build armored suits based on existing designs. vanko tells hammer they are doing everything wrong.on the plane back home, tony and pepper are watching the aftermath of the events that took place and are watching a rather angry senator stern unload his frustrations with tony on the oreilly factor. stern is saying that tony stark lied to the senate armed forces committee, and that hes in danger of being arrested on felony perjury charges: stark had told the senate that other countries, as well as hammer industries, were 20 years away from having anything that remotely resembled iron man, however vanko surprised everyone by making an working copy of the arc reactor. tony presents pepper with a gourmet meal and is going to tell her the truth, but they have an awkward moment as pepper knows that something is up and that tony isnt telling her the whole truth.back home, tony is using jarvis to conduct investigations into ivan vanko. he finds that vankos father anton vanko was howard starks partner and one of the co founders of stark industries. howard stark found out that vanko was conspiring to sell weapons to the soviet empire and had him arrested for treason and deported to russia, where he was imprisoned. his son had been seeking revenge against the stark empire ever since. while sitting in one of his hot rods in his basement, tony nearly collapses and is discovered by rhodes who tells him that this isnt a good look for him. he shows rhodey how the palladium is slowly poisoning him. rhodes also tells him that hes been battling with the pentagon by stopping them from coming to his malibu house and taking his suits to be used for weaponized purposes.tony is then preparing for what he believes will be his last birthday party. he asks natalie what she would do if this were her last birthday party. natalie responds that shed do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted to do it with. while at the party, tony is extremely drunk and wearing the iron man suit and behaving recklessly with its weaponry. in the background, pepper and rhodes are discussing that hes gone way off the deep end. rhodes tells pepper that hes tired of dealing with the pentagon and the senate armed forces committee. rhodes, finally having enough of tonys antics, goes and dons one of the in-development iron man suits. he then challenges tony to a fight, where tony has the in-house dj play some good background tunes. the battle ends in a stalemate and rhodey flies off in the mark ii armor, delivering it to military authorities at edwards air force base. justin hammer is later invited to study the suit himself and provides them with advanced weapons to arm it with.the next day, tony is at the famous los angeles landmark doughnut shop randys doughnuts, sitting in the iron man suit atop the famous giant plastered doughnut. disgraced and hungover, tony is approached by shield director nick fury, who tells stark that despite the problems hes having with the government and his drunken iron man antics, which are the least of his worries; fury has an issue to deal with in the southwest united states. tony wonders if fury and the \"avengers initiative\" is real, and fury reassures tony that its real, and that he knew howard stark very well, in fact howard was one of the founding members of s.h.i.e.l.d., the agency he works for. they are joined by agent phil coulson and natalie rushman, whose real name is natasha romanoff, a s.h.i.e.l.d. agent planted in stark industries to monitor tony himself. a hungover tony is stunned at this revelation and fires natalie/natasha, but she then tells tony that its none of his business and that hes under investigation from s.h.i.e.l.d. , and she and agent coulson are there to make sure tony follows orders and doesnt screw up. fury and natasha both mention tonys palladium poisoning; tony replies that hes investigated and tested every know element and every permutation of them with no success. natasha injects tony with a serum that slows the symptoms of his palladium poisoning significantly, giving him the time to find an alternate element to keep him alive.fury tells tony some more detail about anton vankos relationship with howard stark and provides tony with a chest of his fathers old artifacts that can hopefully be used to find a cure for his condition. tony resists further attempts from s.h.i.e.l.d. interference, but agent coulson reassures tony that hes not going anywhere until tony finds the answers that hes seeking about his condition. reviewing the film reels in the chest, stark discovers a message from his father that leads him to the original 1974 diorama of the stark expo. he retrieves the diorama from his old office, now occupied by pepper, and tries to reconcile with her. in reality, the diorama is a disguised diagram for the atomic structure of a new element that howard couldnt produce in his time but tony may be able to with his advanced knowledge.stark performs a radical alteration of his home workshop and hand-builds a particle accelerator with the aid of his computer system, j.a.r.v.i.s. stark synthesizes this new element, creating a new triangular chest arc reactor that cures his poisoning and is much more powerful than starks earlier versions. just before tony completes the particle acceleration, coulson tells him that hes free to go and that s.h.i.e.l.d. has reassigned him to another case in new mexico.at hammer industries, vanko has radically changed the design of hammers suits: they are now automated drones. despite what vanko considers improvements, hammer is displeased and imprisons vanko in a small room with two guards while he takes the drones to the stark expo.hammer unveils his new military drones, captained by rhodes in a heavily-weaponized version of the confiscated mark ii armor. unfortunately, it is soon discovered that vanko has programmed the drones, giving himself complete control. he also has control of rhodes new armor, and stark arrives just as they go on the attack. as stark battles these remote-controlled enemies and tries to evade rhodes, happy hogan and romanoff race to hammers queens facility to stop vanko. by the time they arrive, vanko has already departed for the expo in a new armored suit, an updated version of the harness he used when he attacked tony in monaco. back at the stark expo, just as hammer has finished his presentation, the drones attack the standing-room-only crowd and they begin to flee. stark and rhodes chase after the drones and destroy each and every one of them, while agent romanoff and pepper have justin hammer arrested for harboring the fugitive vanko.natasha is able to give rhodes control of his armor again so that he and stark can fight vanko together. the two armored allies combine their powers and successfully destroy all the drones. vanko then lands in the area, wearing a greatly updated armored suit with improved plasma energy whips. after a grueling battle, stark has an idea for he and rhodes to use a trick from their earlier battle during starks birthday party, firing their energy repulsors to collide and create the same explosion with vanko caught in the middle. the maneuver takes vanko down, but vankos armor and drones are revealed to have been equipped with self-destruct charges. as they begin to explode, stark races to save pepper, rescuing her at the last moment. after landing on a roof she quits her ceo position, and she finally gives tony a kiss, to which they both find rhodes sitting a few meters away. tony finally tells pepper the truth about his heart, upsetting her greatly. stark tells rhodes to leave, but rhodes then claims he was there first, so they should get their \"own roof\" after stark tries to defend himself.at a debriefing, fury informs stark that while stark is \"unsuitable\" for the \"avengers initiative,\" shield wants stark as a consultant. stark agrees on the condition that senator stern personally present him and col. rhodes with their medals for bravery, however senator stern is less than amused when he presents tony with his medal.in a post-credits scene, shield agent coulson is seen driving to a remote impact crater in the new mexico desert. he informs fury over the phone that theyve \"found it\"; in the crater is mjolnir, the hammer of thor.][\"the story opens about two years after the events in avengers: age of ultron. thor (chris hemsworth), having failed in his quest to locate the infinity stones and having also been dumped by jane (although he insists it was a mutual dumping) is hanging in chains above a fire pit before being brought before the monstrous fire demon surtur. surtur believes his destiny is to bring about ragnarok, the complete destruction of asgard. thor learns from surtur that odin (anthony hopkins) is not on asgard, so uses mjolnir (his hammer) to escape and destroy surtur, keeping his crown/skull, the demons power source. thor returns to asgard and sends surturs skull down to the vaults but then finds heimdall (idris elba) has been replaced as sentry of the bifrost bridge by the inept skurge (karl urban) who explains that odin accused heimdall of treachery. heimdall subsequently fled and his whereabouts are unknown.reaching asgard, thor sees a massive statue of loki (tom hiddleston) as well as odin lounging around, enjoying a play about lokis heroic sacrifice while fighting the dark elves. realizing whats happened, thor quickly forces loki (who usurped and disguised himself as odin prior to the end of thor: the dark world) to drop his charade and demands to know what happened to odin. it is revealed that loki had placed odin under a spell and dumped him in a retirement home in new york city. by the time they get there it is being demolished. before they can plan their next move, loki is suddenly pulled through a dimensional hole in the sidewalk and a card with an address (177a bleecker st) is left behind. thor goes there and finds doctor stephen strange (benedict cumberbatch), the mystic guardian of earth, who agrees to help him find odin on the condition that all asgardians leave earth. thor agrees, and after doing some research (during which thor is constantly teleported around stranges sanctum, a disorienting experience) doctor strange deduces that odin is in norway. he then releases loki from his endless fall, and when loki tries to attack an exasperated strange, the doctor unceremoniously sends them both through another portal.they find odin in norway sitting near a scenic cliff (having shaken off lokis spell) and he admits that he is dying and ragnarok is approaching. thor insists that when he destroyed surtur, he prevented ragnarok. odin mentions hela (cate blanchett), his true first-born child, the goddess of death and the one who will seize asgard from odins sons. odin tells thor and loki that their (previously unknown) sister was completely consumed by darkness and was sealed away, the only force that continues her exile is odin himself. he apologizes to thor for failing him before dying and disappearing. as soon as hes gone, hela emerges from her prison and engages the two in brief small talk. seeing that she wont be reasoned with, thor throws mjolnir towards her however the goddess easily catches and effortlessly shatters the long-indestructable weapon. loki, seeing they dont stand a chance, asks to be returned to asgard via the bifrost, however hela also enters the portal, expels loki and then thor from it at different points and reaches asgard. arriving at the bifrost bridge, she quickly kills volstagg (ray stevenson) and fendral (zachary levi) before recruiting a terrified skurge to her cause. she then heads to asgard when she kills the entire palace guard single-handedly as well as hogun (tadanobu asano).thor is deposited by the portal on a planet, sakaar, which seems to consist entirely of gigantic garbage mounds, fed by giant portals in the skies. hes attacked by several scavengers. now weapon-less, he is quickly overpowered before his attackers are scared off by the hard-drinking bounty hunter valkyrie (tessa thompson). however she then captures thor, placing a small shocking device on his neck to pacify him, and takes him to the grandmaster (jeff goldblum) who is delighted with his newest acquisition and decides to put him up against his champion fighter. thor learns that loki is also present and has been there for weeks (time moving far quicker on the grandmasters planet) during which he has found favor with the grandmaster. not wishing to jeopardize his position, loki pretends not to care about his brother and thor is thrown in the dungeons where he befriends rock-creature korg who explains that all who have gone up against the champion have been killed. meanwhile, hela enters asgards throne room and pulls down the fresco above the throne depicting odin and the royal family and their benevolent rule of their kingdom and the universe, revealing the darker history of asgard where odin and hela conquered the nine realms before she was banished by her father. hela then heads down to asgards vaults and uses asgards eternal flame to restore her entire army and revive her monstrous wolf, fenris. (she also dismisses the infinity gauntlet that is kept there as a fake). she then attempts to open a portal and conquer all the realms but the bifrost sword has been taken by heimdall who has been hiding in the hills and is now sheltering the escaping civilians from asgard.thor is taken to the arena and put up against the champion who is revealed to be none other than the incredible hulk. thor is overjoyed to see his old teammate, however the hulk attacks him. the two bash each other around the area, thor gaining the upper hand. he tries using natasha romanovs calming technique to make him transform back into bruce banner (mark ruffalo) however it doesnt work and hulk thrashes him (loki is very unsettled to again see the creature that gave him a sound beating during his attempted conquest of earth). eventually thor stops holding back and begins to fight, at one point having a vision of odin causing him to channel raw lightning. however just when he is about to win the grandmaster, not wanting to see a crowd (and his own) favorite be beaten, shocks thor into submission. as the hulk leaps into the air to crush thor, thor puts his hand up in defense before everything goes black.on asgard, hela has the remaining people rounded up and demands to know where the bifrost sword is. when no-one comes forward, hela tells skurge to execute a random person. skurge hesitates, but is still about to do it, but before he can make the kill someone comes forward with heimdalls location.thor wakes up later in the hulks chamber, being pampered by several beautiful women. thor speaks to hulk privately (hulk is now able to speak far more intelligently than he was able to in his last appearance) and learns that he hasnt transformed back into banner since leaving earth two years earlier. the hulk points out that the quinjet he left earth with is still in one piece and could be used to escape. he also learns that valkyrie is an asgardian who was part of an elite all-female group who were sent up against hela during her previous assault but were all killed (valkyrie being the only survivor). thor tries to convince her to help, but she initially refuses. although hulk is happy in his life and wants to stay, he does help thor acquire the control device for his electronic restraint -- thor pickpockets it from valkyrie and removes the shocker from his neck. thor escapes from hulks apartment and reaches the quinjet, but is chased by hulk who smashes it half apart. however thor then plays black widows (scarlett johansson) last message to him, prompting the hulk to transform back into bruce banner. thor explains to banner, whose last memories are of sokovia during ultrons offensive, what has happened. banner, unable to believe hulk was able to remain in control for two years, doesnt want to transform again knowing that if he does he might remain the hulk forever. valkyrie meets up with loki and the two engage in a brief fight, and after loki learns where she comes from he uses his powers to make her remember her last encounter with hela. valkyrie has a change of heart and she decides to help thor return to asgard, and shows her good will by beating and chaining up loki. reuniting, thor and loki head down to steal a ship however loki attempts to betray thor to the grandmaster. thor, expecting such a move by loki, places the shocking device onto lokis back. thor tells his brother hed hoped he would at least show some capacity for growth and even begin to change for the better, but now he understands loki will always be a trickster. he then leaves the shocking device turned on with the remote just out of reach.thor, banner and valkyrie steal the grandmasters party/orgy ship and, escaping the grandmasters clutches, leave through a passageway known as the devils anus. reaching asgard just as hela is about to destroy the remaining population who had attempted to escape through the bifrost bridge, thor engages her in a vicious battle but is still overpowered and loses an eye. feeling he is useless without his hammer, thor has a vision of odin who explains to his son that the hammer simply channeled his powers, reminding him he is the god of thunder. odin also tells him that asgard is not a place but its people and they can re-establish their society and culture anywhere. now realizing his full abilities, thor unleashes a massive lightning bolt repelling hela. as valkyrie and heimdall attempt to hold off helas army, loki unites with korg and other escaping fighters and procures a ship which he uses to evacuate the asgardians. banner also transforms back into hulk to fight off fenris. skurge, feeling guilt over having allied himself with hela, sacrifices himself to ensure the ship is able to escape.thor unites with valkyrie and loki knowing hela will soon be back as she is only growing stronger from asgards power. thor suddenly realizes that he cannot stop ragnarok but must instead bring it about to defeat hela, and sends loki down to the vaults to throw surturs skull into the eternal flame. loki does so and escapes (its also heavily implied that he takes the chance to steal the tessaract) just as surtur is resurrected and starts laying waste to the kingdom. hela mounts an offense but it is little use -- surtur is too powerful and destroys her with his sword. thor escapes with loki, hulk, heimdall, valkyrie, korg and the surviving civilians/prisoners just before asgard is completely decimated. although thor is upset about the destruction of his home, he knows it was necessary to prevent the extinction of his people. he then finally meets his destiny and takes the throne (the captains chair on the bridge) where his first order is to return to earth.mid-credits scene:loki worries over thors decision to return to earth knowing he wont be very welcome there since on his last visit he tried to take over the planet. thor assures his brother he feels everything will be fine, just as a menacing ship that dwarfs their own appears through the window.post-credits scene:the grandmaster, who had been chasing thor, crashes on the garbage planet where he is confronted by the scavengers who are also a bunch of former slaves. he congratulates them on their revolt and agrees to call it a tie.\"][bright headlights cut through a thick sheet of snowflakes. a scientist, bundled as warmly as possible, treks through the sleet. two other men, in matching black cold-weather uniforms, approach the scientist. he leads them to an excavation site which is easily the size of a football field; at the center of the site appears to be a giant wing and fuselage. the black-suited men cut through the fuselage of the mystery craft and enter. inside they find the remains of a massive, frozen ship. one of the men brushes away at the snow and sees a shimmering red, white, and blue shield encased in ice.tonsberg, norway, 1942:two caretakers for an ancient viking ruin listen as their town is overrun by nazis. suddenly the front door blasts open and in flood multiple nazi agents. one of the caretakers is killed in the blast and the other frantically begs that the soldiers leave him in peace. they pay no attention to the old man and instead open the buildings crypts one-by-one. they come to one sarcophagus whose lid is too heavy to lift. a dark figure appears in the exploded entryway. johann schmidt (hugo weaving), a high-ranking nazi and leader of the hydra sect, nonchalantly enters. he crosses the room, comes to the difficult-to-open sarcophagus and easily pushes the lid free. within he finds the skeletal remains of an old viking clutching a glass cube (the tesseract). the caretaker pleads for schmidt to leave it. schmidt scoffs and tells how this cube would be the jewel of odins treasury if it werent a fake. he smashes it on the floor and goes to the caretaker, asking where the real cube is hidden. the caretaker initially refuses but under threat of harm to his family, he relents, gesturing to a hidden drawer across the room, part of an ancient carving the size of the wall. schmidt pries the drawer open and finds the real, glowing cube concealed within. schmidt orders his men to shell the city and then shoots the luckless caretaker.at a recruiting station in brooklyn, steve rogers (chris evans), a 20-something, 90 lb, 5-foot tall asthmatic eagerly awaits the opportunity to enlist in the united states army. the army doctor gives a once-over to steves medical file, which reads like that of a 90 year old man, and rejects steves application as the military 4-f, as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist.distraught, steve heads to the movies. he envies the enlisted men featured in the pre-show newsreel, and watches as other audience members tear up. a loud-mouthed, impatient movie-goer begins yelling at the screen \"start the movie! i didnt pay to see this crap!\" steve tells the man to shut up, and is surprised as the man turns around, stands up and towers above him. in the alley behind the theater the bully savagely beats the scrawny steve, who bravely fights back, but is easily overpowered. when his opponent asks him why he wont simply give up, the bloodied steve says \"i can do this all day.\" james \"bucky\" barnes (sebastian stan), steves best friend, comes running to the alley. he swiftly kicks the bully away and tends to steve, who is annoyed that bucky showed up and got rid of the bully just as steve got his second wind. \"bucky\" is now an enlisted-man. his application was accepted and hes been assigned to the 107th infantry.in a celebratory mood, bucky invites steve to go dancing with a pair of girls on a double date. bashfully, steve tags along. the four head to the worlds fair in queens. while bucky canoodles with his dates, steve watches as playboy inventor howard stark (dominic cooper) unsuccessfully demonstrates a flying car. steve breaks away from the group and goes to another recruiting station. bucky catches up with him and asks how steve intends to forge his application this time. unbeknownst to them both, dr. abraham erskine (stanley tucci) while passing by, eavesdrops on their conversation. he is fascinated by the gumption of steve. bucky wishes steve good luck on his latest application and steve heads in to the recruiting station for his fifth physical. inside steve sits on an examination table and grows nervous when an mp enters the room, and is soon followed by dr. erskine. dr. erskine has all of steves prior applications, and recognizing steves strong will and unwavering conviction, he accepts his latest application.in a secret military installation high in the alps, johann schmidt brings the glowing cube to dr. arnim zola, his hydra weapon specialist. the cubes seemingly limitless power enables schmidt and dr. zola to power unstoppable energy guns and cannons.meanwhile, steve has been enlisted into basic training under the careful watch of dr. erskine and colonel chester phillips (tommy lee jones). he and his platoon are told that they are candidates for the governments latest super soldier program. phillips is unimpressed with steve and is vexed by dr. erskines interest in him. during basic training steve meets a beautiful, but serious british officer, peggy carter (haley atwell), who seems to pity steve. despite being the smallest and weakest of the platoon, steve demonstrates the greatest spirit and selflessness and ingenuity, especially when his platoon are charged with retrieving a flag from the top of a tall pole. as the other more fit men in the company fail one by one, steve casually walks over to the pole and pulls the pin holding it up, taking the flag when the pole crashes to the ground. phillips, still unconvinced, tosses a grenade into the group during calisthenics and they all scatter. phillips is surprised when steve alone leaps on top of it, willing to sacrifice himself to save the others, before discovering that the grenade was a dummy. phillips concedes to erskines decision.that evening dr. erskine speaks with steve. the two bond over a bottle of schnapps and dr. erskine reveals that this is not his first time performing this experiment. he tells a story of how as a scientist in germany, he was ordered by johann schmidt to create a serum that would give a man god-like strength. dr. erskine created an early version of the serum he intends to use on steve, only when schmidt injected himself his bodys skin corroded away, leaving him as a sinewy red skeleton. undeterred by the risk, steve agrees to follow through with the procedure.the following morning steve and peggy wind their way through brooklyn and come to a stop in front of an old antique shop. along the way steve points out various parts in brooklyn where hes been beaten up. she asks him why he never ran away. he responds that running away, in his mind, was an invitation for further abuse.the two enter the antique shop, exchange pass-codes with an old woman manning the register, and descend into a secret military bunker concealed within. peggy leads steve to the heart of the bunker where they find dr. erskine preparing a medical capsule along with howard stark, and colonel phillips rubbing elbows with senators and dignitaries. steve is told to remove his shirt and sit in the capsule. stark describes that the procedure will first mean injecting muscle re-generators into rogers major muscle groups which will then be bombarded with \"vita rays.\" erskine has made no secret of the pain steve will endure but promises hell come out stronger. carter bids steve good luck and joins phillips in the overhead viewing chamber. erskines serum is injected into steves muscles and steve is enclosed within the vita ray capsule. the capsule glows brightly, steve yells in pain but also tells them to continue and the procedure is quickly completed. when the capsule is shut down, steve comes out a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier with solid muscle, which is just the most superficial aspects of his body artificially raised to the maximum human potential.everybody, including phillips, celebrates the success of the procedure, and descends from the viewing chamber to congratulate erskine. a lone dignitary, in actuality a german spy named heinz kruger (richard armitage), stays behind, placing a small satchel on a chair. moments later the viewing gallery explodes. kruger descends the stairs and fatally shoots dr. erskine twice. he swiftly kills the guards and flees onto the streets with peggy in hot pursuit. steve tends to a dying dr. erskine, who has just enough energy to point to steves heart before he dies. steve bolts out of the bunker, in pursuit of kruger.in the street peggy pursues kruger, and easily kills his getaway driver. kruger steals a taxi and aims to run over peggy. steve arrives in the nick of time, saving her from being killed by the on-coming taxi. steve pursues the taxi on foot, running faster than a normal human can (and not suffering the fatigue even a healthy man would). displaying superhuman agility, he leaps onto the roof of the taxi, dodges krugers gunfire and the two come to a crashing stop at the brooklyn docks. kruger shoots at steve, who holds the star-imprinted door of the wrecked cab in front of him as a shield. kruger flees to his hydra sub, which dives underwater just as steve arrives. steve dives after the sub, punches a hole through the cockpits glass and yanks kruger to the surface. kruger tells steve that he is the first of many, that rogers can \"cut off one head,\" but two more take its place.\" he then kills himself with a cyanide capsule hidden in a fake tooth, letting out one last \"heil hydra!\" before dying.meanwhile, schmidt and dr. zola are visited by a trio of hitlers top commanders, tasked with inspecting schmidts operation. they ridicule schmidt, saying that the nazi party no longer takes him and hydra seriously due to his obsession with magic and the occult and playfully refer to him as \"the red skull\", a name that infuriates schmidt. schmidt takes the three to his weapons lab where they are shown his unstoppable energy weapons and a strategic map of europe dotted with targets. one of the three notices a target hovering over berlin and confronts schmidt. schmidt quickly vaporizes the three nazi officers. schmidt announces that hydra has disbanded from the nazi party and is now enemies with the world.the following day phillips and carter pick up the remains of dr. erskines lab. both are despondent because the only person capable of producing the serum was erskine himself. steve is eager to go the front lines of the european theatre but phillips would rather he be a lab-rat than a soldier in his army. steve is approached by a senator holding a newspaper of the prior days events, emblazoned with a front-page photo of steve chasing down heinz kruger. steve has become an overnight celebrity and the senator has an idea that will be mutually beneficial.steve is enlisted in the uso (united service organizations), and travels around the midwest, promoting war bonds and performing musical numbers in a shoddy red, white and blue costume while carrying a triangle-shaped shield bearing the stars-and-stripes. he takes on the name \"captain america\" and the show includes a theme song written specifically for him, features dancing girls and a short segment where he punches out hitler, played by an actor. captain america becomes an overnight success, spawning comic books and black and white movies. his antics drum up revenue for the uso.steve is soon taken overseas, to italy, where he is to continue entertaining the troops. upon his arrival the surly and war-torn men tease him and tell him to get lost. he is soon met by carter, who along with phillips, is overseeing european theatre of the war. she tells him that the men are unhappy because many men from their division, the 107th infantry, have been killed in battle. steve realizes that this is buckys division, and quickly runs to see phillips. phillips is unable to find buckys name on his casualty list and tells steve to go back to his job as a movie star and a cheerleader. steve asks carter where the men, and bucky, are being held. she shows him a map, and a known hydra weapons factory 30-40 miles behind enemy lines. steve hastily pulls on a pair of army trousers and leather jacket over his captain america costume, and a blue helmet with a white a stamped on the front. he aims to steal a jeep and drive into hydras back yard, but she has a better idea.howard stark flies them both over the battlefield in his private plane. steve surmises that stark and carter have a relationship and bashfully withholds his feelings for her. just as anti-aircraft guns from hydra begin firing on starks plane, steve parachutes in, while the other two escape back to safety. steve stealthily makes his way into the hydra base, taking out numerous guards in the process.inside, schmidt and zola are manufacturing enough weapons to wipe out every capital in the world. steve makes his way to the holding cells where he sees hundreds of imprisoned men from the 107th. he frees the men and tells them to make a \"messy\" exit. under the leadership of the \"howling commandos\" the prisoners manage to overpower their captors, steal guns and tanks, and escape from the facility, destroying much of it. schmidt watches steve by cctv, and quickly realizes that he must be erskines man. he quickly activates several explosive charges that will level the base.steve makes his way through the facility and happens across bucky, who is tied down to an operating table, and has quite obviously been tortured. steve also notices an oversized tactical map mounted on the wall, with various marked installations. steve frees bucky, who is surprised to see that steve is taller than him, and commits the map to memory.the two head up the catwalks and find themselves face to face with schmidt on a retractable bridge. rogers punches schmidt, who surprisingly stands his ground. schmidt plays with his face, which has apparently come free from his skull, and quickly peels it away as a mask. the red skull stares back at rogers and bucky and swiftly enters an elevator. in the elevator the red skull tells arnim zola to meet him at another one of hydras bases and to take his car. the red skull escapes the exploding facility in a strangely-designed private plane while zola sneaks away in schmidts roadster. inside steve and bucky have a huge divide to cross to their freedom. bucky crosses a trembling, buckling support beam and manages to cross to safety moments before the beam plummets into the fire below. left with no other option, steve backs up as far as he can and leaps over the burning chasm.back at the 107th base camp, phillips dictates a letter to his typist, telling how rogers disappeared the prior night and likely perished during the battle. at that, phillips berates agent carter for causing this loss and notes that unlike the indispensable stark, she herself can be punished. carter attempts to justify her actions, but phillips bluntly dismisses her opinions considering that the loss of rogers, the only successful test subject of project: rebirth, would be ample justification to close down their organization. just then, rogers arrives, with nearly 400 survivors of the 107th carrying samples of the red skulls technology including some combat vehicles leaving the base in a fervor. rogers submits himself to phillips for disciplinary action for going out in direct violation of orders, but is forgiven. at this success, bucky calls for cheers for rogers, who has truly become captain america.the news of \"captain americas\" success on the battlefield has swept over the world, but rogers does not appear for his medal from congress. the reason for that absence is in london, where steve gives phillips and carter his best recollection of the hydra base map and tells them that he intends to go to those bases and destroy them one by one, and wishes to recruit a team of men made up of those he liberated in italy. steve meets the howling commandos in a bar and they eagerly accept the offer. while there all the men are surprised as peggy enters dressed in a form-fitting cocktail dress. she ignores all the men, including bucky, and flirts with steve, telling him that shed love to have a dance with him some day.the next day steve is summoned to the brooklyn bunker to see phillips and stark. steve is approached by a beautiful female officer who wishes to thank him for his service the best way she knows how. peggy walks in on steve kissing the enlisted-woman and angrily storms away. steve apologetically follows her to starks lab, insisting that he gets nervous around women and asks why he should apologize if carter and stark have a thing going. stark quickly shoots down the rumored relationship and takes steve to his weapons engineering lab. he remarks that rogers has become attached to the triangular shield, which steve says is a handy tool in the field. on a table are several prototype shields with sophisticated components, however steve finds a plain, circular shield on a lower shelf. stark explains that the shield is made of a metal called \"vibranium\", which is lighter than steel and is vibration resistant and will absorb heavy impacts. he holds the shield in front of him and asks peggy for his opinion. she playfully/scornfully fires a clip from a .45 pistol at the shield, which steve ducks behind. the shield passes the improvised test admirably. as she walks off, steve passes a sketch of a uniform to stark.steve dresses in red, white and blue fatigues, dons a blue form-fitting helmet and stows the newly-colored shield onto his back. captain america and his soldiers, including bucky, make their way across europe, flattening hydras bases one by one, with rogers becoming quite skilled at using the shield as a projectile weapon and also discovering that it can ricochet off several surfaces and lot lose any velocity. news of his exploits reach the red skull and zola. the skull is furious, referring to rogers as a \"simpleton with a shield\" and murders the last man alive at one of his destroyed facilities.high in the alps, steve and his men have a mission to capture zola in his personal train. three members of the team, cap, bucky and gabe jones (derek luke), zip-line across a massive chasm and storm the train car by car. soon cap and bucky are cornered by heavily armed hydra soldiers. they narrowly defeat the soldiers, however bucky is tossed from the train and plummets into an icy river below. zola is apprehended.zola sits in a prison cell and is visited by colonel phillips, who brings him a steak dinner. zola rejects the meal, convinced that it must be poisoned. phillips shrugs and eats it himself. he tells zola that he broadcast an easily decipherable message, which has certainly been intercepted by hydra, saying that zola had defected. he also knows that zola is easy to bargain with since hes the sole hydra agent theyve captured who hasnt taken his cyanide capsule to avoid disclosing information. zola, fearing that the lie will result in his death by the red skull, gives in to phillips and tells him information of the red skulls only remaining hydra base.rogers sulks in a war-ravaged bar. carter arrives and comforts steve over the loss of his best friend. steve realizes that dr. erskines serum rapidly regrows dead cells, making it impossible for him to get drunk. the two flirt a bit and talk about having a dance, once again.rogers and his team prepare a battle plan to take down red skull at his headquarters. rogers, dressed in a new uniform, mounts a harley and charges the base. he easily dodges hydra soldiers and tanks and finds himself within the base, surrounded by a hydra army. he is taken into custody and led to the red skulls private weapons lab. red skull asks what makes steve so special. steve says \"nothing, im just a kid from brooklyn,\" moments before members of his team zip-line into red skulls office.a climatic firefight ensues, as hundreds of soldiers under the direction of phillips and carter storm the base, killing many hydra soldiers. red skull flees to his private hangar, in which a gigantic flying wing, powered by the tesseract, is preparing for take off. steve attempts to catch up with the plane on foot, but is unable. phillips and carter arrive in the skulls roadster, and the three take off after the plane. just as steve is about to leap onto the plane peggy stops him and kisses him. steve leaps from the roadster onto one of the planes massive wheels. he sneaks into the craft where he finds dozens of kamikaze planes/missiles, each labeled with a different major american city. hydra soldiers soon enter the room and steve battles them, taking out numerous men and tiny planes. one of the planes, labeled new york, drops free. steve takes off after it and manages to commandeer the craft and crashes it back into the flying wing after throwing the pilot through its rearward mounted propeller.inside the large cockpit, captain america and red skull have a fisticuffs battle. red skull fires his cube-energy pistol at steve who easily deflects the shots using his shield. a shot is deflected into one of the cockpits center consoles which contains the glowing blue cube. the console is damaged and skull lifts the cube into the air. suddenly a portal opens above him, showing starry space. the red skull glows brightly and is seemingly disintegrated. his remains are swept up into the cosmos. the cube, still glowing brightly, drops to the ground and burns its way down through the planes hull before plummeting into the ocean below. steve mans the planes controls and radios carter. he tells her that the plane is on a flight-path that will take them to the eastern seaboard. he tells her that their dance will have to wait. he pushes the plane into a dive and crashes it into a glacier below. peggy can only hear static.steve awakens in a 1940s hospital. an old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a brooklyn dodgers game. he gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. a young nurse (amanda righetti) who bares a striking resemblance to peggy enters. she waits for a response from steve, who looks her over suspiciously. he asks why the radio is playing a game from may 1941... specifically, a game that he knows he attended. she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a two-way radio. two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and steve easily tosses them through a wall. steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that the hospital is in fact a movie-set. he runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open, and finds himself in a modern skyscraper bustling with people in business suits. he flees the building and finds himself in times square, circa 2011. he peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black suvs encircle him.nick fury (samuel l jackson) appears and carefully speaks to steve. he tells him that hes been asleep, in ice, for 70 years, in a state of suspended animation. the hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. still perplexed, steve breathes heavily and sadly tells fury that he had a date, as he realizes everyone else he used to know in the 1940s is long dead or very old now.in a post-credit scene, steve is in an old-fashioned gym. he pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off its chain and sends it flying across the room. fury enters the gym and asks steve if hes had trouble sleeping. steve cynically asks if fury has come with another mission. fury replies in the affirmative.suddenly we see images of all the superheroes, who include steve/captain america, thor (from the movie of the same name), tony stark (from the ironman movies), hawkeye, black widow, bruce banner (from the incredible hulk) and other shield agents preparing for battle. fury tells him that \"theyre up.\" his personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete, previewing the avengers.][nick fury (samuel l. jackson), director of s.h.i.e.l.d. (strategic homeland intervention, enforcement, and logistics division), arrives at s.h.i.e.l.d. headquarters outside of santa fe, new mexico, during an evacuation. the tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, has activated. it opens a portal through space and the exiled norse god loki (tom hiddleston) steps through, carrying a strange spear with a blue glowing tip. loki takes the tesseract and uses the spear to take control of the minds of several shield personnel, including dr. erik selvig (stellan skarsgård) , and agent clint \"hawkeye\" barton (jeremy renner), to aid him in his getaway. shield personnel pull out of their base when an energy surge from the tesseract causes the ground beneath the base to collapse and destroying it. a short pursuit of loki fails to capture him.in response to the attack, nick fury issues a state of emergency, telling his top agents phil coulson (clark gregg), natasha romanoff (scarlett johansson), and maria hill (cobie smulders), that they are completely out of options. fury pulls romanoff and coulson out of their respective assignments and sends them to find the heroes he needs to oppose loki. romanoff is found in eastern europe interrogating suspects, and coulson pulls her off the assignment and sends her to find \"the big guy\": bruce banner (mark ruffalo), aka the incredible hulk. banner has been living in exile in india working for a hospital in calcutta helping sick people, and has found inner peace doing so. romanoff tells banner about the tesseract and its destructive capabilities. as the worlds expert on gamma rays, banner is their best chance to find the cubes location.during a video chat with the world security council, the superiors who run s.h.i.e.l.d., fury is grilled about his plan to bring about the avengers initiative. the wsc are furious, saying that its the wrong thing to do and these people will never work together as a group. fury says they have no other option and this is their only hope of defeating loki. the superiors reluctantly agree.steve rogers, (chris evans) on the other hand, is relatively easy to find. s.h.i.e.l.d. has been keeping tabs on him since he was found in the ice and still alive. fury goes to greet rogers at his gymnasium where he finds he doesnt sleep. fury tells rogers that he will find a briefing packet about whats going on back at his apartment. tony stark (robert downey jr.) is seen in a new iron man armor that has underwater capabilities. he is installing a new electrical connection that will take his office building completely off the electrical grid allowing it to become self sustaining. hes greeted at his office by pepper potts (gwyneth paltrow) who tells him that its date night. tony wants pepper to know how it feels to be a genius and after an argument about how much credit she should get for coming up with the stark tower idea, date night is off. coulson arrives, and tony quickly and repeatedly tries to cut him off. coulson hands tony a laptop with all the data on it about everything thats going on. pepper decides instead to go to washington dc to get the zoning permits for the next two buildings for stark tower as it seems tony has homework to do, and a lot of it.on the airplane to the secured location - an aircraft carrier that can convert to a flying aircraft carrier, coulson is telling rogers about how its such an honor that they found him and tells him about his captain america trading card collection. they then head to the helicarrier and rogers is introduced to dr. bruce banner. the two then wonder what kind of ride theyre in for. rogers thinks its a submarine but the last thing dr. banner should be riding in is a submerged, pressurized metal container. the carrier takes off. on board, they are briefed that dr. selvig and loki have been traced to stuttgart, germany.rogers first assignment is to go to stuttgart to arrest loki and bring him on board the helicarrier. loki is at a formal black tie gala at an art museum where he is kidnapping a doctor who harbors the element they need to make the tesseract work. while dr. selvig creates a distraction and hawkeye kills the men guarding the building, loki carries out his plan. outside, he is instructing the civilians present that they need to kneel before him - or else, and that freedom is lifes great lie. however, one old man stands up in defiance, and loki prepares to strike him down. however, the killing shot is neatly blocked by the shield of rogers as captain america before moving to confront the god. as rogers battles loki, tony makes his entrance to the tune of ac/dcs \"shoot to kill\" with full iron man weapons drawn to knock down the god and daring loki to make a move.loki quickly surrenders when the two heroes arrive, and while being flown to the high tech prison on board the helicarrier, the plane encounters a lighting storm. rogers asks loki if hes afraid of lighting but loki tells him its not the lightning that hes afraid of. its what follows. thor (chris hemsworth), lokis half-brother and the norse god of thunder, arrives and attempts to capture loki so loki can face asguardian justice for his crimes (which will be more effective than earths), but thor gets into a fight with rogers and tony. the fight ends in a stalemate. eventually, loki is taken to the helicarrier and placed in a glass cell designed to hold the hulk. fury explains that if loki attempts to escape, even by merely cracking the glass, a shaft will open below him and hell plummet to earth and possibly be killed.on board the aircraft carrier, the fully assembled avengers squad is being briefed by fury about what they think will possibly happen next. loki is in prison and is interrogated by agent romanoff. tony stark arrives and it seems the only one of the group he really gets along with is bruce banner. while conducting experiments on lokis scepter, stark tries to get a rise out of banner so he can witness banners famous party trick (read: turning into the incredible hulk). banner flinches and then begins telling about how hes been unable to fully harness his abilities and that he suffered depression after the accident. thats why he moved to calcutta, as helping people is what gives his life meaning.the avengers, now brought together, argue and deliberate over how to approach loki and the revelation that shield plans to harness the tesseracts power to develop weapons, a discovery made by rogers. fury admits that the events in new mexico a year before (recounted in thor (2011)) made shield aware of other races on other worlds, some of whom may see earth as an easy target. thor is seen asking agent coulson about what happened to jane foster. coulson tells him that s.h.i.e.l.d. has placed her in their witness protection program and that shes in a safe zone in london.the decision was made to produce weapons with the tesseract as a means of deterrence. as the group argues, clint barton and lokis possessed agents attack the helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight. while stark and rogers attempt to restart the damaged engine, romanoff tries to prevent dr. banner from turning into the hulk and destroying the ship from inside. her attempt fails and shes chased through the ship until thor takes up the battle to pacify the beast and manages to fell him briefly with a hit from his hammer, mjolnir. while fighting barton, romanoff slams him into a guard rail, and the blow to the head breaks lokis mind control. after the hulk falls from the ship, thor is tricked into lokis holding cell by loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows thor to plummet. loki is held at bay briefly by agent coulson but is also tricked by one of lokis holographic projections - coulson is stabbed in the back by the real loki. coulson later shoots loki with a blast from an unidentified weapon, one that harnesses the power of the destroyer. coulson dies while fury tries to save his life. thor escapes from the cell a split second before it hits the ground. banner wakes up in his human form after crashing into an abandoned factory.fury uses coulsons apparent death to motivate the avengers to work as a team. stark and rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for loki. he needs to overpower them in a very public way so as to validate himself as ruler of earth. using a device built by dr. selvig, loki opens a portal to the chitauri home world over manhattan, summoning a chitauri invasion. once again the groups petty differences overshadow their ability to communicate as a team, especially with banner now missing. while in an argument with rogers, tony finally figures out that loki is a full tilt diva, and that hes obviously set up shop at the top of starks office.natasha, unfortunately arrives too late just as dr. selvig has opened the portal. this unleashes lokis army and all hell breaks loose. the army is massive and they cant all fight them off as much as they are entering the earths atmosphere. tony stark thankfully shows up, as does bruce banner. while fighting, rogers dispatches nypd cops to direct citizens into the underground tunnels and sewers. meanwhile, the hulk smashes, and tony arrives at stark tower where he attempts to stall loki with a drink which is used to threaten and intimidate him. as thats going on, tony has jarvis prepare an under development version of iron man called mk18 which is contained in a giant box coded specifically for tony and has advanced weapons capabilities. loki refuses to cooperate, saying the destruction will continue as long as the citizens of earth dont get that they need to be ruled by him. loki attempts to take control of stark by using his scepter on his heart to control his mind, but it fails thanks to tonys somewhat trusty arc reactor that keeps him alive.the avengers rally in defense of new york, but quickly come to the conclusion that they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of chitauri descend upon earth. with help from the reformed barton, rogers and thor evacuate civilians while dr. banner transforms into the hulk and goes after loki, beating him into submission in tony starks penthouse. romanoff makes her way, with a little help from the chitauri, to the device that holds the portal open (conveniently located on the roof of the stark building) and hits dr. selvig over the head, freeing him of lokis control. dr. selvig reveals that lokis staff can be used to close the portal.as thats happening, hulk confronts loki, who refuses to be intimidated by such a beast. as rogers instructed, hulk smashes loki into near oblivion. that allows romanoff to grab the scepter and head to the roof to shut down the portal. while romanoff is securing the portal, stark is securing the perimeter. meanwhile, with fury on a conference call to the council, fury berates the councils decision to launch a nuclear missile at manhattan. fury tries everything possible to stop the council from launching nukes, even destroying two jets that are taking off from the helicarrier. unfortunately as hes about to fire on a third, it gets away and launches a nuclear weapon.tony intercepts the missile and he knows exactly where to put it - he flies it into the portal. while in the portal, stark instructs jarvis to try pepper one last time. unfortunately the call fails as pepper is on a plane and glued to the tv with other stark industries executives. tony launches the nuke at the chitauri mothership, completely destroying the invasion. all the invading aliens collapse and are rendered useless. stark sees the nuke go just as he runs out of oxygen and falls to what appears to be certain doom. thankfully he manages to escape the portal just as romanoff is able to successfully close it. once back in the atmosphere it looks like tony isnt going to make it, but is saved by the hulk thanks to incredible timing. a dazed stark, awakened by the hulks roar, offers to take the team out for shawarma, but they decide to apprehend loki first. the avengers go their separate ways. romanoff, rogers, and hawkeye return to working for s.h.i.e.l.d., tony and pepper are seen rebuilding stark tower and are working on the next phase of the project. thor escorts loki and the tesseract back to asgard where loki will stand multiple trials for war crimes from both asgard and the chitauri. meanwhile, multiple tv news reports recap the events surrounding the avengers, and while theyve become worldwide heroes for to some for their efforts in new york, others are fearful and want to know who will take responsibility for the devastation.on another video conference call with the world security council, fury is being congratulated, but they also grill him that now their secrets out, this group is too dangerous for the world to handle. and fury is glad - what happened in new york is a warning. a warning to all galaxies that if they try to attack earth, s.h.i.e.l.d. is there to defend it. and they have just the team. fury also tells the s.h.i.e.l.d. board that the avengers whereabouts are no longer being tracked. theyve earned a leave of absence, but will be called back when needed. he also tells the council that the tesseract is where no one on earth will ever be able to find it.in a mid-credits scene, the chitauri leader the other tells his master that it is futile to attack earth, as fighting the avengers is like courting death. his master turns, revealing himself to be thanos, a worshiper of the personification of death, smiling at the chance to court her with more loss of life.after further credits, the avengers are shown eating together in a shawarma joint; the team looks worn out and no one speaks.][the movie opens with tony (robert downey jr.) narrating a story about how we create our own demons. in a flashback to new years eve 1999, tony, meets a botanical scientist named maya hansen (rebecca hall) in bern, switzerland, and arrogantly avoids crippled nerdy scientist aldrich killian (guy pearce), who wants tonys backing in his endeavor, advanced idea mechanics (aim). maya has an experimental plant. maya has been working on experimental (and in some cases unethical) biological research in plants that causes their dna to change drastically and has the power to cure incurable diseases and paralysis.in december 2012, it has been quite some time after the events of new york city and the avengers initiative (from the avengers) when iron man/tony stark saved new york. a haunted tony stark has obsessively built several iron man suits in his mansion. tony works on a new model, the mark 42, which is modular; all the suit pieces fly to him and recombine. the first attempt at making the mk42 work is met with a funk version of \"jingle bells\" with tony dancing while the pieces are coming at him. as per the course, tony of course completely ignores any safety measures that jarvis takes. it ends rather poorly when tony is thrown across the room attempting flight with the mk42 and it shatters into pieces. jarvis of course gloats with an \"i told you so\" moment.tony then continues his story about creating demons. he then talks about how he turned on the tv to find a new terrorist at work called \"the mandarin\" (ben kingsley). the mandarin hijacks american airwaves and makes his american debut by taking credit for the bombing of a us military station in kuwait that killed the wives and children of soldiers out on maneuvers. president elliss initial response to the mandarin however makes him the butt of the jokes of late night talk show hosts: it seems the only thing that hes able to come up with is to take the mk8, the suit worn by colonel james rhodes (don cheadle) and formerly known as \"war machine\" and have it repainted, rebranded, and reintroduced as \"the iron patriot\".tony later asks rhodes in a restaurant whats really going on with the mandarin. rhodes tells tony that while the media and the press only know of three bombings attributed to the mandarin, there have been at least six more that have taken place off the books. rhodes explains that hes now operating mk8 as the \"iron patriot\" (formerly known as war machine). while the two are coming to an agreement that the name chosen was horrible, tony is confronted by a group of kids who want his autograph. tony jokes that the boy looks very much like ralphie from a christmas story. the girl asks how tony was able to escape the worm hole in new york, causing him to freak out. tony makes a b-line for his iron man suit and enters, jarvis explains that tony is suffering a massive anxiety attack.back at stark industries, pepper potts (gwyneth paltrow) goes to meet her 4:00 appointment. the appointment is aldrich killian, who has cleaned himself up since 1999. aldrich wants stark industries backing in his think tank called \"advanced idea mechanics\". aims goal is a biological experiment called \"extremis\" which harnesses the brains power to alter human dna. he then shows pepper a massive hologram reconstructing of his brain and how extremis can utilize parts of the brain that would otherwise go unused. pepper tells aldrich that stark industries isnt interested in funding aim because the ideas could be translate into human weapons.happy hogan (jon favreau) has found a new career as the head of security at stark industries although hes annoying nearly 99% of the companys personnel and visitors with his penchant for requiring everybody to wear badges, and pepper explains that complaints against him have risen nearly 200% since he started working there (which happy takes as a compliment).pepper drives home and tony has a huge stuffed bunny for her as her christmas gift. however, he is busy working and pepper isnt greeted by tony, but by another remote-controlled prototype of the iron man suit, and that has her rather upset. tony has developed a heads-up-display (hud) and is using it as a remote control. that night while asleep, tony is having some bad ptsd induced trauma about what happened in new york. theyre then startled when one of the new prototype iron man suits is awakened and has made its way into the bedroom. tony then immediately dismantles it. a frustrated pepper tells tony that shes going to sleep downstairs and has him \"tinker with that\" after he explains to pepper that hes been a complete mess since the events in new york and has been unable to sleep.the next day happy follows one of killians men, eric savin (james badge dale), to the graumans chinese theater. savin gives another man, jack taggart, a briefcase. happy tries to intercede but is beaten senseless by savin, and seconds later, taggart overheats and explodes, leaving behind only his old dog tags. happy is left severely injured, while savin walks away. hours later, the mandarin hijacks the tv airwaves to take responsibility for the blast.tony is now furious over happy, who has been knocked into a coma by the bombing.. after visiting the hospital to check on happy, and to make sure that all of the hospital employees were wearing badges while in happys room (not to mention make sure that the tv is playing downton abbey (2010) as its happys favorite show), tony is mobbed by reporters. one of them blatantly asks if tony is going to kill this guy. a frustrated tony then asks the reporters if thats what they really want, then issues his threat to the mandarin saying that he just died and gives his home address on tv, egging on the mandarin to carry out an attack on his home and that hell be ready. tony then angrily destroys the reporters tape recorder and tells the mob of reporters to bill him.while at home, tony has jarvis bring up a hologram diagram of the destruction at graumanns chinese theater. while jarvis is analyzing the attack, tony discovers that happy is pointing to a curious oddity of military dog tags with the name \"jack taggart\" etched onto them. since there was no active military personnel at the blast, tony wonders exactly what the dog tags are doing there. jarvis then analyzes the latest mandarin attack and compares with past incidents. this blast at the theater bears resemblance to an incident that happened four years ago in rose hill, tennessee, and predates any known mandarin attack, where an ex-army soldier named chad davis blew himself up, taking five people with him. tony asks jarvis if hes ever been to tennessee. jarvis then creates a flight path for the iron man suit.hes interrupted when the doorbell rings. a paranoid tony wonders why hes getting visitors since he told jarvis that the house is on complete and total lock down. the visitor turns out not to be the mandarin, but dr. maya hansen, who believes tony is in danger. a freaked out pepper is arguing with maya and just as thats happening, the house is attacked by three helicopter gunships disguised as news choppers. tony commands the mk42 suit to cover and protect pepper. pepper and maya survive the attack. tony gets the mk42 back and manages to destroy two of the helicopters, but down on power he cannot fly. the house crumbles into the sea, taking tony with it. the suit regains some power and flies off, unseen. tony passes out.sometime later, tony awakens in the suit when jarvis sets off the low battery alarm. he then sees hes plummeting towards the ground and crashes into a snowy forest at full speed. initially, he thinks hes in northern california, but jarvis informs him that hes actually five miles outside of rose hill, tennessee. tony is exasperated, but jarvis reminds him that he asked for a flight plan to be made. with no more power, jarvis shuts itself down.tony trudges through the snow, dragging the mk42 along with him. he stops at a gas station, where he uses a payphone to call pepper, then steals a poncho off a cigar store mannequin.tony then drags the mk42 to a seemingly empty house nearby. inside, he immediately begins work on repairing the mk42. but the house isnt empty. its occupied by a lonely 10 year old kid named harley keener (ty simpkins), who is stunned to find tony working in his garage. tony asks harley for some help and promises that hell be rewarded later on if he gets the help he needs. harley tells tony that the world thinks hes dead after the attack on his mansion. tony calls himself \"the mechanic\" and harley asks tony one question too many about the events in new york city, causing tony to have another anxiety attack.back at the remains of tonys now completely destroyed malibu mansion, pepper is searching for any clues to find out whether or not tonys still alive. thankfully she is able to retrieve a voice message left from tony recorded after the attack that proves that he is alive. a relieved pepper then seeks answers. tony, working with harley, assumes that harley is being bullied at school because harley keeps making harmless weapons to defend himself with, like a potato gun. tony finally manages to get jarvis back online thanks to a hud display that he developed several months prior to the bombing.teaming with harley, tony investigates the remains of the mandarin-esque suicide bombing. harley tells tony about all the rumors surrounding the attack and the \"soldier\" in question. tony notices that there are five shadows on a concrete wall, from the five victims who were killed along with chad davis.tony then meets with daviss mother at a bar, where he notices shes expecting someone and has a file on hand. he is about to ask her more questions when one of killians agents, ellen brandt, shows up and suddenly cuffs tony. she poses as a homeland security agent to explain her actions to the sheriff, but when he starts asking her for identification, she shoots him. tony manages to escape the bar, only to be cornered by savin. he manages to defeat brandt by luring her into a room where hes opened a gas line, and heats up daviss dog tags in a microwave. the explosion throws brandt into a telephone line and electrocutes her. savin tries to take harley hostage, but harley overpowers him, allowing tony to grab his car keys and escape.tony drives off in savins car. while he drives, the mandarin hijacks the airwaves once more and explains that hes going to brutally murder the ceo of a major oil company on live television if the president doesnt contact them within a specific time frame. despite the president making the phone call, the mandarin carries out the shooting, warning that the president is his next target.tony calls rhodes, who has managed to locate what they think is the mandarin. rhodes takes his suit to the middle east. there, he is shocked to find nothing but an abandoned warehouse which doesnt have a single trace of the mandarin. he also finds that the file he got in rose hill is a document from advanced idea mechanics, killians company.back in tennessee, tony drives to a nearby beauty pageant, and sneaks into one of the camera crew vans so he can research the data on the documents hes found. fortunately for tony, the van is being operated by one of tonys biggest fans, who even goes so far as to have iron mans likeness tattooed on his arm - though rather unrecognizable. tony hacks into aims servers and finds video footage that sheds new light on what is going on: the bombs are the work of soldiers from the extremis program, an experimental treatment intended to allow its users to recover from crippling injuries like amputations. however, if a users body cannot properly metabolize extremis, the users body heats to an extreme temperature and explodes. after veterans started growing unstable and exploding, their deaths were used to cover up extremis flaws by manufacturing a terrorist plot. the test footage shows that a number of early subjects were killed because of extremiss flaws.rhodes tracks the mandarins ip address and is led to a sweat shop in the middle east. but it turns out to be a trap, for one of killians agents disarms him and knocks him unconscious. then killians men steal rhodess suit.tony uses the ip address that the mandarin has been using to hijack american airwaves and traces him to miami, florida. tony infiltrates the estate headquarters using a variety of home-made weapons fashioned from stuff bought at a hardware store, harleys trade mark potato gun, and a limited edition dora the explorer watch belonging to harleys unseen sister.inside he discovers the mandarin is actually a flighty british actor named trevor slattery (ben kingsley), who is oblivious to the acts the mandarin has carried out. when confronted, slattery manages to tell both tony and rhodes that hes the mandarin, and manages to completely annoy them both, and tony goes to confront killian, while rhodes stays behind and tries to get any information he can out of the completely clueless slattery. tony is captured by some of killians henchmen - who are also extremis experiments, and maya reveals she was working with killain all along. she thinks tony can help perfect the extremis dna. aldrich arrives and reveals he has kidnapped pepper and subjected her to extremis, intending to infuse her with superhuman abilities and turn her against tony as leverage to gain tonys aid in fixing extremis flaws. aldrich then shoots and kills maya.tony escapes his captivity by summoning the mk42 suit from tennessee, and reunites with rhodes on the estate, discovering that aldrich intends to attack president ellis aboard air force one. unfortunately as time is critical, the mk42 has yet to regain full flight power. savin boards the presidents plane wearing the iron patriot suit, shoots the secret service agents aboard and takes the president. savin then blows holes in the airliner body and survivors fall out. iron man kills savin and manages to rescue the falling people, tony had been controlling the unit by remote control. meanwhile the iron patriot suit flies away with the president on board. tony and rhodes trace aldrich to an impounded oil drilling platform where aldrich intends to kill ellis on live television. the vice president will become a puppet leader, following aldrichs orders in exchange for extremis to cure a little girls disability.rhodes manages to locate the president in a massive ship yard at miamis port. tony enacts a new strategy, and has jarvis enact the \"house party protocol\" which unleashes a massive army of iron man suits - each one different from the next. on the platform, tony goes to save pepper, and rhodes saves the president. tony summons a fleet of his various iron man suits, controlled remotely by jarvis, to provide air support and attack the many other extremis infected guards. rhodes secures the president and leads him to safety, while tony discovers pepper has survived the extremis procedure. however, before he can save her, a container crane rig collapses around them and she falls 200 feet to her apparent death. tony is forced into confronting aldrich using several suits and finally traps him in the 42 suit that self-destructs. but, a glowing aldrich survives and staggers toward a defenseless stark. killian tells tony that the mandarin was made up, that he is the mandarin and that all attacks were taken out by extremis experiments. pepper shows up with extremis powers and finishes off the weakened aldrich.after the battle, tony orders jarvis to implement \"clean slate protocol\" which destroys each remaining iron man suit remotely, as a sign of his intention to devote more time to pepper. the vice president and slattery are arrested. in a voiceover tony mentions he cures pepper, and tony himself undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. he pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing he will always be iron man, even without his armor. he gathers some scrap parts from his house wreckage and drives off in his audi etron. he then leaves harley with a rebuilt lab and new version of harleys trademark potato gun, telling him that iron man will be back and leaves a thank you note from \"the mechanic\".in a post-credits scene, it is revealed that stark has been recounting his experiences to dr. bruce banner (mark ruffalo, uncredited), who awakens, having fallen asleep at the beginning of tonys story, followed by the words \"tony stark will return\".][eons ago, bor, the father of odin, clashes with the dark elf malekith, who seeks to destroy the universe using a weapon known as the aether. after conquering malekiths forces, including enhanced warriors called the kursed, on their home world of svartalfheim, bor safeguards the aether within a stone column. unbeknownst to him, malekith, his lieutenant algrim, and a handful of dark elves escape into suspended animation.in present-day asgard, loki stands imprisoned for his war crimes on earth. meanwhile, thor, alongside warriors fandral, volstagg and sif repel marauders on vanaheim, home of their comrade hogun; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the nine realms following the reconstruction of bifröst, the \"rainbow bridge\" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier. in london, astrophysicist dr. jane fosters intern, darcy lewis, now with her own intern, ian, takes jane to an abandoned factory where objects have begun to disobey the laws of physics and disappear into thin air. separating from the group, jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the aether.the asgardians learn that the convergence, a rare alignment of the nine realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. heimdall alerts thor of janes recent disappearance, leading thor to search for her. when she inadvertently releases an unearthly force while being arrested by the police for trespassing on private property, he takes her to asgard. however, the asgardian healers say they do not know how to treat her. odin, recognizing the aether, warns janes infection will kill her given enough time, and that the aethers return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.malekith, awakened by the aethers release, turns algrim into a kursed and attacks asgard. during the battle, malekith and algrim search for jane, knowing she contains the aether. when they fail to capture her, they escape, but not before killing thors mother frigga in a swordfight. despite odins orders not to leave asgard, thor reluctantly teams up with loki, who knows of a secret portal to malekiths world, where they will use jane to lure and confront malekith, away from asgard. in return, thor promises loki that he can have his revenge on malekith for killing their mother. with volstagg and sif stalling asgardian soldiers and fandral assisting their escape, thor and loki commandeer a dark elf spaceship and escape to svartalfheim with jane.on svartalfheim, loki tricks malekith into drawing the aether out of jane. however, thors attempt to destroy the substance fails, and the aether-empowered malekith leaves with his ship as loki appears to be fatally wounded while protecting thor from algrim. thor, cradling loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. following lokis apparent death, thor and jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite with janes mentor dr. erik selvig, darcy and ian in london. there, they learn that malekith plans to unleash the aether to destroy the universe, and that he will do this in greenwich, the center of the convergence. thor battles malekith, but a portal separates them, leaving malekith unopposed. thor comes back in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport malekith to svartalfheim, where he is killed before he can destroy the universe.thor returns to asgard, where he declines odins offer to take the throne and tells odin of lokis sacrifice. as he leaves, odins form transforms to that of a grinning loki.in a mid-credits scene, volstagg and sif visit the collector and entrust the aether to his care, commenting that, with the tesseract already in asgard, having two infinity stones so close together would be dangerous. as they leave, the collector remarks, \"one down, five to go.\" (foreshadowing the guardians of the galaxy movie.) in a post-credits scene, jane and thor reunite on earth, while somewhere in london a frost monster from jotunheim, accidentally transported to earth during the final battle, continues to run amok.][two years after the events of the avengers (2012), retired soldier sam wilson (anthony mackie) jogs around the tidal basin in washington, d.c. catching up to him very quickly is steve rogers, a.k.a. captain america (chris evans). steve completes multiple laps over sam until the latter gets tired and sits to rest. sam joins him and they introduce themselves. sam is a war veteran and he knows steve has been adjusting to life in the 21st century, and that he has a lot to catch up on. he recommends that steve listen to marvin gayes \"trouble man\" soundtrack to get up to speed on the last few decades. steve adds it to his list, along with things like \"star wars/trek\" and \"rocky.\" steve gets a text telling him to stand by the curb in front of the capitol. a car pulls up, driven by natasha romanoff, a.k.a. black widow (scarlett johansson). she greets the two men and steve hops in the car.the duo joins other s.h.i.e.l.d. agents led by brock rumlow (frank grillo) as they fly over the indian ocean. a s.h.i.e.l.d. vessel, the lemurian star, has been taken over by pirates led by georges batroc (georges st-pierre). they are holding hostages, including agent jasper sitwell (maximiliano hernández). steve, in his captain america outfit, dives out of the jet armed only with his shield and no parachute. he lands in the water and climbs onto the ship, beating every goon that comes in his way. natasha and the other agents drop down to aid cap. the agents defeat the pirates and rescue the hostages while batroc tries to run and is caught by cap. they fight on the deck of the ship, with batroc getting quickly back up on his feet even when cap manages to take him down. \"i thought you were more than a mask,\" he says smugly. steve removes his mask and replies, \"lets find out.\" he continues the fight and knocks batroc down for good with his shield.steve finds natasha extracting files from the ships computer using a s.h.i.e.l.d. flash drive. when steve calls her out, she tells him shed been given a different mission by nick fury. she pulls the flash drive out, moments before a pirate runs past and throws a grenade at the two. steve grabs natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes.at the triskelion, s.h.i.e.l.d. headquarters across the potomac river from washington dc in virginia, steve confronts nick fury (samuel l. jackson) about the motives behind natashas task. fury knew steve wouldnt be comfortable with it, so he asked natasha. fury reminds steve that he cant trust anybody, even those who work closely with him. he takes steve into an elevator down to the cavernous underground level where there are three helicarriers being worked on as part of project insight, an operation that connects the helicarriers to spy satellites used to prevent any possible terrorist attacks. in part a response to loki and his chitauri horde that attacked new york, steve sees this as more of an aggressive form of protection. fury insists that he get with the program.steve visits the smithsonian museum to check out an exhibit dedicated to captain america. a child recognizes him in disguise, but steve holds a finger to his lips asking the kid not to point him out. the kid understands and keeps quiet. among the displays are mannequins with his world war ii uniform and the costumes of steves old commando squad, and one of his old friend bucky barnes (sebastian stan), whom steve saw fall to his death (in the first captain america film). steve checks out a video of his old love, peggy carter (hayley atwell), in which she commemorates steve on his actions as cap. he later visits an elderly peggy, who has since been married and had children. she is ill and although she initially appears to recognize steve, she slips back into a state where she believes shes seeing him again for the first time since he was lost, shocked to see him alive. he merely says, \"i couldnt leave my best girl. not when she owes me a dance.\"fury tries to access the files that natasha got on the flash drive, but he is unable to get past security, something that was apparently set by himself. he goes to meet with defense secretary alexander pierce (robert redford) as he is meeting with the world security council over the matter of the hijacking of the lemurian star. fury tells pierce that they need to delay project insight. pierce says okay, but he wants fury to have iron man stop by his nieces birthday.steve finds sam counseling other veterans suffering from ptsd. after the group meeting, sam reveals to steve that he lost his friend riley in battle in iraq after he was shot down in the air with an rpg. despite the lost of his friend, sam still loves flying. he asks steve what makes him happy. he doesnt know.as fury drives, he contacts agent maria hill (cobie smulders) to rendezvous with him. as he stops at an intersection, a police car pulls up alongside furys car on his passengers side. fury notices that the officers driving the car are looking at him very suspiciously -- perhaps because hes a black man driving a very expensive suv. the driver hits his siren for a quick second and pulls forward.just as fury pulls into the intersection, another police car appears and t-bones furys car on the drivers side, sending it into some bollards. the first police car suddenly stops and backs straight into furys car. a third police car simultaneously plows into furys car from behind, and several more units quickly arrive, boxing furys car in. the first police car to hit fury then backs up. a second later, a black windowless van screeches to a halt, discharging a full swat team. the patrol and swat officers draw submachine guns and assault rifles and take up positions around furys car. the onboard computer informs fury that the dc metropolitan police dispatch shows no units in the area. fury is also told that he has a broken arm and he quickly injects himself with a painkiller.seconds later, the police officers open fire, riddling the car with bullets. it does them no good, as the car is armored and the windows are made of bulletproof glass. the fake police move to their next strategy: four men from the swat team grab a hydraulic battering ram from their van. they unfold a tripod and plant it next to the car. the operator pushes a button so that the tripod drills holes into the pavement to stabilize it, before firing it. each hit rocks the car sideways and weakens the window drastically. just as the windows integrity reaches 1%, fury grabs a hidden minigun and returns fire through the window. most of the pseudo-cops on the scene are immediately hit and killed, while the swat van and one of the police cars are blown up by a grenade launcher. after a prolonged exchange of gunfire, he commands the car to drive itself out. furys car takes off on autopilot with two police cars in hot pursuit.a lengthy pursuit unfolds through the streets. after forcing their way through stopped traffic, and another running shootout, the two police cars catch up to fury and begin to trade paint with him. fortunately for fury, his onboard computer detects a box truck about to catch up to them at the next intersection. fury slams on his brakes, while the two police cars continue on and are broadsided by the truck.fury commands the vehicles computer to get him to a safe location and speeds off. before the computer can find a safe spot for him, he sees figure dressed in black (sebastian stan) standing in the middle of the road. the mysterious mercenary shoots a magnetic bomb that attaches itself to the underside of furys car. it explodes and flips the car over. the would-be assassin walks over to the vehicle, ready to finish fury off, but he escapes in time by burning a hole through the roof of the car and the street below with a laser weapon.steve goes back to his apartment to find his pretty neighbor, sharon carter (emily vancamp), going to do laundry. he offers to let her use his machine, but she says she just spent a lot of time in the disease ward of the hospital and doesnt want to pass any sickness to steve. she tells him that he left his stereo on.steve hears music as he cautiously enters his house, grabbing his shield for protection. he finds an injured fury sitting on his couch. out loud, fury says his wife kicked him out, but he shows steve through text on his phone that anybody could be listening. before he can say anything else, fury is shot three times. steve looks out the window for the shooter. fury hands him the flash drive and tells him not to trust anybody. the neighbor comes in, armed with a gun. she is agent 13 of s.h.i.e.l.d., and she tends to fury. steve runs after the sniper. steve smashes through the walls to catch up with the assassin outside. he throws his shield at him, but the sniper catches it with one swift move in his left hand, then throws it back to steve. steve catches the shield and is shoved back a bit and looks up, only to find the assassin has disappeared.natasha meets up with steve at the hospital, where they watch doctors operating on fury. agent hill joins them. the doctors try to revive him, but fury flatlines. they call in his death. afterwards, natasha asks steve why fury was in his apartment. he claims to not know, right as rumlow tells him they need him back at s.h.i.e.l.d. natasha calls steve a bad liar, and they separate. we see that steve hid furys flash drive behind a pack of gum in the vending machine.steve is brought in to speak with pierce. he also asks steve why fury was in his apartment, hoping to find clues to who killed him. they suspect batroc after he was found the previous night in a safe house. pierce insinuates that fury hired the pirates to infiltrate the ship so that he could acquire classified information, and was then killed after the deal went wrong. steve denies the claim. pierce asks him again why fury was there. steve only says that fury told him not to trust anybody.steve hops on the elevator, which becomes occupied with more s.h.i.e.l.d. agents at each floor it stops at, including rumlow. steve notices one agent looking sweaty, and others looking very suspicious, itching for their pistols. he asks anybody if theyd wish to get out, prompting them all to attack him. they strap magnetic cuffs to his wrists and hold an electric stunning rod to him, but steve overpowers them and knocks everyone out cold, including rumlow. agent sitwell sees the battle through a monitor and orders the strike team to get to the elevator. steve breaks off the cuffs with his shield and sees the strike team heading his way. he breaks off the elevator wires to send the elevator down. the team still approaches, so steve breaks through the glass in the elevator, falling dozens of floors and hits the plaza, landing on his shield. he runs to the garage and rides out on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out by s.h.i.e.l.d. a quinjet emerges to shoot at steve. he throws his shield into its engines, disabling it and giving him an opportunity to hop over it and escape.sitwell orders s.h.i.e.l.d. agents to be on the lookout for steve. agent 13 demands to know why theyre issuing a manhunt for captain america. pierce comes into the room and brands him a fugitive for withholding information on furys death.steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine, but its gone. natasha appears, chewing some gum. steve pushes her into a room and demands to know what she knows about the mysterious assassin. she and intelligence agencies only know the assassin as the \"winter soldier.\" he nearly killed her on a mission in iran, during which the target she was assigned to protect was killed, and he has reportedly been responsible for over 200 assassinations over the past 50 years. they decide to use the flash drive to find out what they can on the winter soldiers whereabouts.pierce meets with the wsc members again, defending fury as a martyr, though they believe he was killed for trying to cover up his own illegal dealings. they all opt to reactivate project insight.steve and natasha go to a mall, disguised as a civilian couple. they take the flash drive to an apple store and pop it into a macbook pro to find signal coming from wheaton, new jersey. natasha tells steve that they have 9 minutes or less before s.h.i.e.l.d. agents find them. on the way out, the duo spots rumlow and other s.h.i.e.l.d. agents coming around every corner. natasha pulls steve in for a kiss on the escalator to draw attention away from themselves, since public displays of affection make people uncomfortable (and make faces harder to see). the ruse works and rumlow doesnt spot them.steve and natasha drive where the signal pointed, ending up at an abandoned military base. steve recognizes it as his old training base in new jersey, and he briefly envisions his former, smaller self running past him. he and natasha enter the facility, which is discovered to be an original s.h.i.e.l.d. office. they find framed portraits of howard stark and peggy, along with col. chester phillips. steve looks behind a bookshelf and uncovers a room full of computers. the only modern type of technology in the room is a small port for the flash drive. natasha inserts it and activates a computer. a german voice speaks and analyzes the two. the voice belongs to arnim zola (toby jones), former accomplice of the red skull. he transferred his consciousness into a computer once his body failed him because of a disease. zola tells the duo that his and red skulls group hydra was formed on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom, and after the war s.h.i.e.l.d. recruited him and other hydra operatives, where they conspired against their new employers. he reveals that they were directly responsible for targeting people such as the president, along with causing the car accident that killed howard and maria stark. zola adds that a missile is heading for their location in less than 30 seconds. steve and natasha jump into a hole as the missile hits, destroying the computers. steve protects himself and natasha as the place crumbles. rumlow and his goons search the place to make sure there are no survivors.in his home, pierce bids goodbye to his housekeeper, renata (branka katic), just as the winter soldier appears in his kitchen. he never speaks a word. pierce starts to talk to him when renata comes back to get her phone. remarking that he wishes shed knocked, pierce shoots her twice because shes seen him and the winter soldier talking.steve and natasha hide out at sams home, knowing they can trust him. natasha expresses remorse over her involvement with hydra agents. sam decides to use a military project called falcon to help them. when he asks steve and natasha if they can retrieve the item for him, they scoff, saying itll be easy.back in d.c., sitwell walks away from meeting senator stern (garry shandling. before they part ways, stern leans in and whispers to sitwell, \"hail hydra.\" sam calls sitwells phone and orders him to walk to a car to meet with him and his friends. the heroes take sitwell up to the roof of a tall building. steve holds sitwell over the edge, threatening to drop him. sitwell knows this isnt steves style. steve agrees... and lets natasha kick sitwell off the roof. moments later, sam, in his falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up to the roof holding sitwell. the now terrified traitor confesses that zola created an algorithm to locate certain people around the world based on personal facts or data. he name-drops tony stark (iron man), bruce banner (the hulk), and stephen strange (hinting at a future doctor strange (2016) movie). the targets are picked based on their past actions. sitwell realizes that pierce may very well kill him.en route back to the triskelion, the winter soldier jumps onto the heroes car, pulls sitwell out through the window, and throws him into the path of a truck. the assassin is joined by other hydra agents in attacking the car. steve pulls natasha and sam out, sliding on the car door through the streets. they fight off the villains, with winter soldier pursuing natasha while the hydra agents fight steve and sam. winter soldier thinks hes found natasha hiding behind a car and he shoots a bomb to her, but it was really a recording played back on a phone. when he does find natasha, he shoots at her. steve jumps out and battles winter soldier. the assassin is just as fast and even stronger than steve. steve manages to remove his mask, and he finally learns the assassins identity -- bucky barnes. steve stares at the man who was once his friend, unable to believe that he is standing before him alive and trying to kill him. \"bucky?\" he asks. \"who the hell is bucky?\" the winter soldier responds. the hydra agents take steve, sam, and natasha into custody.the heroes are transported in a prison van. sam notices natasha is bleeding seriously from her shoulder and tells the guards she needs assistance. one guard pulls out an electric rod, neutralizing the other guard. the first guard turns out to be agent maria hill (cobie smulders) in disguise. she takes the heroes to a secret facility to treat natasha, but first she shows them fury lying in bed, very much alive. he survived with an anti-stress serum developed by banner, originally to control his hulk problem. when he and natasha are a little more rested, they gather with the other heroes over the fact that project insight is set to launch within hours -- the helicarriers will form a triangle and lock sights on their targets around the globe. the people who will be targeted run the gamut between very minor and very serious threats to national security. fury takes out three chips that they will use to override the helicarriers systems. he turns control over to steve to give orders.within a bank, the hydra agents work to fix the winter soldiers metal arm after his fight with steve. he has brief flashbacks to his old life, from the fall he took to the moment he was recovered by zola and the hydra agents. his left arm was amputated and replaced with the bionic metal arm. when he began to freak out, zola had him sedated and later put on ice. pierce comes in, praising the winter soldiers work and asking him to come back to do it again. winter soldier asks about steve, claiming to know him. pierce orders the agents to get him back to his original killing mindset.steve stands on a bridge, reminiscing about his time spent with bucky. a flashback shows bucky with steve after the funeral of steves mother. bucky offers to let steve stay with his family, and all hed have to do is shine buckys shoes. sam comes over, prepared to join steve in the fight. steve tells him to suit up before going to the captain america exhibit to get his old suit. the elderly security guard (stan lee) sees the suit missing and comments that hes gonna get fired.the wsc members arrive at the triskelion, guided by pierce. he gives them electronic pins that will give them access to anywhere in the building. rogers and falcon break into the headquarters. cap accesses a mic that patches him through to every speaker. he tells the agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. that pierce is a traitor who is working with hydra agents, and that they must stop project insight from happening. rumlow and his goons break into the control room. he forces an agent to release the helicarriers, but agent 13 intervenes. she forces rumlow to drop his gun. he does, then grabs his knife and cuts 13s arm, leading to a gunfight between the s.h.i.e.l.d. and hydra agents. rumlow, amidst the bullets, manages to release the helicarriers himself.cap and falcon make their way to the helicarriers as the hydra agents shoot at them. cap gets the first chip into one helicarrier, while falcon flies around, avoiding getting shot. he manages to get a heat-seeking missile that was aimed at him to hit a helicarrier to give him an entrance, allowing him to place the second chip there. hill, meanwhile, monitors their progress while fighting off hydra agents trying to kill her.pierce tries to convince the wsc members to join him in support of project insight, making it sound like a peaceful effort to subdue potential attacks around the world. he hands councilman singh (bernard white) a glass of champagne, but singh refuses to join him and tosses the glass. pierce pulls out a gun and aims at singh, but councilwoman hawley (jenny agutter) kicks singh away, then takes down the other hydra goons in the room before taking the gun. she removes her disguise to reveal that shes natasha. her backup comes when fury steps out of a helicopter, to pierces surprise. knowing pierce probably changed the retinal scan, fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred dead eye to override project insight along with pierce, as they are the only two agents of the highest degree needed for that. pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, which burn deeply into each members sternum. he threatens to set off natashas, forcing her to walk out with him. natasha activates it herself, burning herself, but not as badly as the others were burned. fury shoots pierce twice, killing him. his last words are \"hail hydra.\"the winter soldier is set loose, killing off the s.h.i.e.l.d. agents trying to aid cap and falcon in taking down the last helicarrier. he rips off falcons wing and throws him off the helicarrier. the hydra agents begin to lock on their targets, with over 700,000 and counting. falcon manages to get his parachute out, leaving him grounded. he runs back into the triskelion to fight rumlow. cap confronts winter soldier inside the helicarrier, trying to get through to his best friend by reminding him that millions could die. unwilling to listen, winter soldier battles cap again. cap runs to grab the chip and replace it, but winter soldier swipes it from him. cap manages to wound both of winter soldiers arms, then puts him in a headlock until he releases the chip. cap rushes to place the chip into the system, but winter soldier shoots him three times. cap still succeeds in installing the chip, calling hill to override the helicarriers. the targets go offline, to the surprise of the dumbfounded hydra agents. with the systems overriden, hill has the helicarriers open fire upon each other. one helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the triskelion. the second crashes through the triskelion, catching rumlow in the destruction. sam runs like hell out of the window as natasha and fury fly their chopper in time to catch him.the third helicarrier continues to fall with cap and winter soldier inside. cap chooses not to fight his friend, dropping his shield out of the helicarrier. winter soldier mercilessly punches him repeatedly across the face, even as cap chooses to stick it out with him until the end. before he delivers the fatal blow, winter soldier looks at cap with hesitance, almost as if he is starting to remember. the helicarrier crashes, throwing cap out and sending him into the water below. he slips into unconsciousness, but not before seeing a hand reaching out for him. winter soldier drags cap to the shore before walking away for good.in the aftermath, steve recovers in a hospital as marvin gayes \"trouble man\" plays. he wakes up to hear the music. we also see agent 13 at a shooting range, agent hill about to undergo a lie detector test at stark industries, senator stern getting arrested, and rumlow being treated by doctors, still alive but terribly burnt. natasha is brought to a hearing to answer for her ties to s.h.i.e.l.d. she defends herself by saying that even if they wanted to put her in an institution, they could not because the council members know they need her and her allies. she coolly walks away. meanwhile, fury gets rids of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them for good.fury meets steve and sam at a cemetery at his own grave. on the headstone are furys name and the words \"the path of the righteous man....\" (this is a reference to the fake bible verse that samuel l. jacksons pulp fiction (1994) character, jules winnfield, liked to quote.) fury tells sam and steve that if anybody asks for him, they only need to come here to his grave.fury leaves as natasha arrives to tell the guys this is furys way of saying \"thank you.\" she hands steve a file that he wanted, then suggests he ask out agent 13, whose name is really sharon carter. steve looks at the file, which concerns bucky and his winter soldier transformation. sam realizes that steve is going to look for bucky. steve tells him that he doesnt have to go with him. sam replies, \"i know. when do we start?\"mid-credits scene:baron wolfgang von strucker (thomas kretschmann) is discussing recent events with a fellow hydra agent in an underground lab somewhere in europe. even though some of their agents have been lost, they have many other followers around the world. they are performing an experiment with secret weapons, including lokis scepter. von strucker guides the agent to \"the twins\" -- pietro and wanda maximoff, a.k.a. quicksilver and scarlet witch (aaron taylor-johnson and elizabeth olsen). they exhibit superpowers of their own: pietro has superhuman speed and wanda has telekinesis, which she uses destructively. observing them, von strucker comments, \"this is the age of miracles...\"post-credits scene:bucky/winter soldier walks through the captain america exhibit at the smithsonian and comes across the display of himself. he stares at it pensively.][missouri, planet earth, 1980meredith quill (laura haddock) is riding in a car, listening to tunes on the radio with her boyfriend (kurt russell), whom she calls her \"spaceman\". they go behind a dairy queen and run into the woods where the man shows meredith a small alien seedling, which he says will eventually be all over the place. he then kisses meredith.34 years later.the guardians of the galaxy, peter quill/star-lord (chris pratt), gamora (zoe saldana), drax (dave bautista), rocket raccoon (voice of bradley cooper), and baby groot (voice of vin diesel) are standing on a platform as they try to secure anulax batteries from their latest employers, the sovereigns. the guardians have their weapons ready as they gear up to battle an interdimensional beast known as the abilisk. the abilisk descends, leading the guardians to spring into action, except for groot, who is jamming out to \"mr. blue sky\" on a speaker that rocket set up, all while the others are trying to annihilate the abilisk. drax ends up falling on the speaker, to groots dismay. since they cannot harm the abilisk from the outside, drax tries to kill it from inside by allowing it to swallow him. star-lord notices a cut on the monsters neck and orders rocket to get it to look up. gamora then slices the abilisk downward, killing it and letting drax spill out of the hole.the guardians bring the batteries back to the sovereigns and meet with their high priestess, ayesha (elizabeth debicki). in exchange for the batteries, the sovereigns deliver gamoras sister nebula (karen gillan) to the guardians so that they can take her to xandar and collect the bounty for her. before they leave, ayesha talks down to the guardians, but peter in particular, noting his half-human/half-alien heritage gives him something she deems reckless. the guardians leave, with rocket swiping some of the batteries for himself.on their way to the planet xandar, the guardians are suddenly met by a fleet of sovereign drones, all going after them for the stolen batteries. the others figure it was rocket that took them, and theyre all pissed off. the drones start attacking as rocket tries to steer the milano toward a wormhole that will lead them to another planet. in the distance, another craft passes by and starts to destroy the sovereign drones. a man appears to stand on his ship and wave to the guardians. the guardians escape the drones but must crash-land on a nearby planet.as the guardians observe the wreckage of their ship, the other ship that saved them descends. stepping out is ego, who reveals himself to be peters father. with him is his empathic assistant mantis (pom klementieff).on another planet, yondu udonta (michael rooker) and his team of ravagers have fallen on hard times. he is staying in a nearby hotel (where howard the duck is also in attendance). yondu spots his old comrade stakar ogord (sylvester stallone), who has exiled yondu from the ravager team for child trafficking. among the ravagers is taserface (chris sullivan), who thinks the ravagers need a new leader, along with kraglin (sean gunn), who has since also come to question yondus leadership. after yondu finishes talking to stakar, the sovereigns arrive, and ayesha approaches yondu with a proposition.peter is still in shock to finally be meeting his father. ego explains that he sent yondu to pick peter up after his mother died. peter still also doesnt understand why ego left meredith in the first place. he invites peter and his friends to his planet, which peter is hesitant about until gamora convinces him to join his father. peter, gamora, and drax go with ego and mantis while rocket and groot stay behind to fix the milano and keep an eye on nebula.on egos ship, the three talk to mantis, who shows off her powers by seeing into their minds. she lets everyone know that peter has sexual feelings for gamora, which drax finds hilarious.the ravagers come across the woods where the guardians crash-landed. most of them end up walking into traps laid out by rocket until yondu shows up with his yaka arrow controlled through his whistling. the ravagers get rocket and groot, but when taserface plans to get peter, yondu isnt quite as willing to turn him over. nebula then breaks the crest on yondus head to knock him out. she aligns herself with the ravagers as they take rocket, groot, and yondu prisoner.ego brings everyone to the planet that literally lives through him, as ego is a celestial and his consciousness is the core of the planet. he explains to the three that he came up with a human form to travel the galaxy and he came to earth and fell in love with meredith, but could not see her so often because it would take up a lot of his energy. peter continues to hold hostile feelings for ego for leaving meredith alone to die. as peter grows more emotional, his hands produce powerful energy that is linked to egos own power. ego shows him how to control and use it.on the ravager ship, taserface and his goons start ejecting those that are still loyal to yondu, except for kraglin, who only watches in disbelief as his friends are killed. when taserface boasts of his greatness and \"fearful\" name, rocket only mocks him. nebula enters and suggests that the ravagers turn in their captives to the kree for the bounties on their heads. she also makes other demands, including a new hand. kraglin brings her to a ship that she uses to get off the ravager ship and to go find gamora.mantis and drax form a bond, though drax continues to remind mantis that he finds her hideous, but that it is a good thing because he thinks he is hideous as well and still managed to find someone else that loved him for who he is. mantis says that she needs to tell drax something important, but gamora interrupts things and mantis keeps quiet, instead just taking the two to their rooms.the ravagers throw rocket and yondu in a cell while they take groot for their own entertainment. yondu mentions how he was kree battle slave before stakar pulled him out and made him a ravager. when rocket asks about why yondu kept peter around, he insists its because peter was small enough to fit in spaces where the others couldnt. the two then resolve to work together to break out of there. they get groot to come by, and yondu tells him to get a prototype fin for his head. after bringing a bunch of wrong items, yondu gets his fin and gets himself and rocket out. yondu sends the arrow through every mutinous ravager they come across, which rocket and groot get in on some ravager ass-kicking themselves. the three board an escape ship with kraglin, but not before yondu sets the whole ship to blow up. taserface gets hit with flames, but he manages to notify ayesha to yondus whereabouts before he goes down with the ship. the other four must go through 700 jumps to get to egos planet.back on egos planet, peter tries to woo gamora with his dance moves, but it doesnt quite work as she cannot bring herself to express her own attraction to him. after she leaves, gamora then sees nebula coming down on her ship, shooting at gamora. as nebula crash-lands, she jumps out to start fighting gamora. nebula manages to overpower gamora but reveals that she never wanted to prove she was better than her, just that she wanted to have a real sister. gamoras success as a warrior led to their father thanos mutilating nebula, leading to her resentment of gamora. the two then form a sort-of alliance as they come across a cavern filled with about a hundred skeletons.peter and ego continue to bond. ego tells peter that as long as there is light in the planet, peter will retain his powers, as well as immortality. mantis sees that ego has peter wrapped around his finger now that he knows about his own powers. she rushes to wake up drax to warn him that egos true intentions are now clear.rocket, groot, yondu, and kraglin make it to their destination. rocket starts to gloat that he wants to save peter just to prove hes better than him and can hang it over his head, but yondu shuts rocket up by stating how scared rocket really is and how he puts on the tough guy thing as a facade. they then set off to take on ego.ego explains to peter that he wants to make what he calls \"the expansion\". he went around the galaxy to thousands of other worlds to plant the seedlings to grow his power over the galaxy and cover the planets in an extension of himself. he impregnated women from those worlds and produced many children that yondu delivered to him, but when they did not possess the same power of a celestial, ego had them killed, and now their bones are what gamora and nebula found. peter just so happens to hold the power that ego was looking for. ego also reveals that he put the tumor that killed meredith in her head so that he would not feel the pain of being apart from her. peter snaps out of it and begins to unload his guns on ego in fury. in response, ego takes peter and controls him to start spreading the seedlings across the planets, causing mass destruction. to top it off, ego crushes peters walkman and awesome mix volume 2 that his mother left him.rocket, groot, and yondu meet up with gamora, drax, nebula, and mantis as they gear up to stop ego. unfortunately, they are also met by a fleet of sovereigns out to kill them as well. peter fights egos human form, but his entire planet self fights back. mantis is able to put ego to sleep while the guardians take care of the others. they fight back against the sovereigns and eventually destroy their whole fleet with a bunch of lasers. meanwhile, rocket builds a bomb using the batteries he stole, which groot takes and runs off with, despite rocket warning him not to push the wrong button or else theyll all die. mantis gets knocked out by a fireball, breaking her hold on ego and reawakening him. as the others try to get safe, ego begins to consume them. peter continues fighting his father using his celestial powers. now freed, groot then finds egos brain in the planets core, and he sets the bomb to go off in five minutes.drax carries mantis to the ship while gamora and nebula make it back. rocket gives his last spacesuit to yondu, knowing he cannot save both him and peter. gamora tries to go back, but rocket stops her so he doesnt lose another friend. ego pleads with peter to stop the bomb, or else peter will just be a normal human. peter sees nothing wrong with that and lets the bomb go off. egos human form disintegrates as the rest of the planet starts to explode. yondu flies by and grabs peter. as they leave the planets atmosphere, yondu puts the suit on peter to save him. he tells peter that while ego was his father, he was never his daddy. yondu then starts to freeze up in space, and peter sadly watches him die.the guardians prepare to give yondu a proper ravager funeral. kraglin gives peter a zune to make up for his lost walkman, which yondu had been meaning to give him for a while. in return, peter gives kraglin yondus arrow, feeling that yondu would have wanted him to take it. nebula sets off to hunt thanos down herself, but not before reconciling with gamora. mantis decides to stay with the guardians. as yondus body goes out into space, the guardians see dozens of other ravager ships arriving to pay their respects to yondu.there are five end credits scenes that follow:kraglin tries to practice using the arrow. he doesnt quite get the hang of it, and he ends up sticking drax with it.nstakar honors yondus sacrifice by forming his own team with martinex tnaga (michael rosenbaum), charlie-27 (ving rhames), starhawk (michelle yeoh), and mainframe (miley cyrus).ayesha and another sovereign discuss their new plan to take down the guardians. we see ayesha sitting by a birthing pod, waiting to break out whatever is inside to use against the guardians. she decides to call it \"adam\" (as in, adam warlock).groot is now a teenager. peter scolds him for leaving his roots lying around, but groot just mocks him and plays video games.the elderly stan lee, in his obligatory cameo, is sitting with the watchers, discussing his previous adventures, but they become bored and leave him.][in the eastern european country of sokovia, the avengers - tony stark / iron man (robert downey jr), steve rogers / captain america (chris evans), thor (chris hemsworth), bruce banner / hulk (mark ruffalo), natasha romanoff / black widow (scarlett johansson), and clint barton / hawkeye (jeremy renner) - raid a hydra outpost commanded by baron wolfgang von strucker (thomas kretschmann), who has been experimenting on humans using the sceptre previously wielded by loki.they encounter two of struckers experiments: the maximoff twins pietro (aaron taylor-johnson), who has superhuman speed, and wanda (elizabeth olsen), who has telekinetic abilities, and can manipulate minds and project energy. rogers captures strucker, while stark retrieves the sceptre after wanda implants a fear-filled vision of a bleak possible future in his mind.back at the teams headquarters - avengers tower (formerly stark tower) - stark and banner discover an artificial intelligence within the sceptres gem, and secretly plan to use it to complete starks \"ultron\" global defence program. after many failed attempts, they leave for a victory party to celebrate the recapture of the sceptre. unbeknownst to them, the program comes to life...the unexpectedly sentient ultron (james spader) awakens, believing that he must eradicate humanity to save the earth, and overwhelms starks ai, jarvis (paul bettany). in the guise of one of starks iron legion robot drones, ultron attacks the avengers as they relax together after their party. escaping with the sceptre, ultron uses the resources in struckers sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. after killing strucker, he then meets and recruits the maximoff twins, who hold stark responsible for their parents deaths due to weapons manufactured by his company.the trio goes to the base of arms dealer ulysses klaue (andy serkis) in an african shipyard to obtain wakandan vibranium. the avengers pursue them there, but wanda subdues all of them except stark and barton with haunting visions, causing banner as the hulk to rampage through a nearby city until stark stops him with his hulk-buster armour. a worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction and the fears incited by wandas hallucinations send the team into hiding at bartons safehouse, where they meet his wife and children, who had been kept a secret from all of them except romanoff.seeing no answers to be found there, thor departs to consult with his friend dr erik selvig (stellan skarsgard) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while romanoff and banner discuss the possibility of fleeing together after realising their mutual attraction. however, nick fury (samuel l jackson) arrives and encourages the team to fight back and stop ultron.in seoul, ultron forces the avengers friend and ally dr. helen cho (claudia kim) to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the sceptres gem, to perfect a new body for him. as ultron uploads himself into the synthetic body, wanda is then able to read his mind, and discovers his plan to annihilate humanity. horrified, the maximoffs turn on ultron and join forces with rogers to distract him while romanoff and barton retrieve the synthetic body. however, ultron captures romanoff while barton reluctantly takes the body back to stark and banner at avengers tower, followed by rogers and the twins.the avengers fight amongst themselves when stark secretly uploads jarvis - who is still operational after hiding from ultron deep within the internet - into the synthetic body. thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow - one of the six infinity stones, the most powerful objects in existence - was part of his vision.this \"vision\" (paul bettany) - proving himself a worthy ally by effortlessly lifting thors hammer mjolnir - and the maximoff twins accompany the avengers back to sokovia, where ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground and cause global extinction. banner rescues romanoff, who pushes him into a pit to rouse the hulk for the battle.the avengers face off against ultrons army of drones, while fury arrives in a helicarrier with maria hill (cobie smulders), james rhodes / war machine (don cheadle) and other shield agents to evacuate the civilians. while the other avengers go to help with the evacuation, wanda accepts the task to guard the machine from activation by ultrons drones. however ultron steals the avengers quinjet and goes on a strafing run in a desperate attempt to stop the evacuation.pietro is killed when he shields barton from ultrons gunfire. the hulk leaps into the quinjet and forcibly evicts ultron - leaving him vulnerable to a vengeful wanda, who abandons her post to destroy ultrons primary body. this then allows one of his drones to activate the machine. the city begins to plummet, but stark and thor overload the machine and destroy the landmass, with the vision swooping in to rescue wanda. the hulk, unwilling to endanger romanoff by being with her, departs in the quinjet, while the vision confronts and destroys ultrons last remaining body.later, the avengers have established a new base run by fury, hill, cho, and selvig. barton returns home to his family, and thor returns to asgard to learn more about the forces which he suspects have manipulated recent events, while stark also leaves the team. rogers and romanoff prepare to train the new team of avengers: james rhodes, the vision, sam wilson / falcon (anthony mackie), and wanda.in a mid-credits scene, thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons the infinity gauntlet and vows to retrieve the infinity stones personally...][in 1989, hank pym (michael douglas) resigns from shield after realizing that howard stark (john slattery) had been trying to replicate his shrinking technology.in the present day, scott lang (paul rudd) has just served his last day at san quentin state prison. waiting to pick him up is his old cellmate, luis (michael peña), who offers to let him stay at his apartment. scott is unable to find a legitimate job with his criminal record. he had found out that the company he worked for had been overcharging their customers, so he hacked into the system and transferred millions of dollars back to the customers. luis introduces him to dave (t.i.), a getaway driver, and kurt (david dastmalchian), an identity theft specialist. luis has a tip about a robbery they could do together.hank gets invited to a presentation at the company he founded, pym tech. he runs into his daughter, hope van dyne (evangeline lilly), and his former protege, darren cross (corey stoll), who shows him a prototype of the yellow jacket suit, modeled after the ant-man suit that hank wore. darren has not had success at shrinking living tissue.scott borrows luis van and drops in on the birthday party of his daughter, cassie (abby ryder fortson). he runs into cassies soon-to-be stepfather, officer jim paxton (bobby cannavale) , who is not happy to see him. his ex-wife, maggie (judy greer) tells him that he has to find a legitimate job and pay off his delinquent child support before shell allow visitation with cassie. jim and his partner, gale (wood harris) insist that scott leave the party after saying goodbye to cassie.at pym tech, hope and darren are trying to shrink sheep to microscopic size. their experiment fails, and a sheep is killed. darren insists they press forward with another sheep.scott realizes that it will be more than a year before he can see cassie again if he takes a minimum-wage job, so he takes up luis on his offer. luis cousin, ernesto (nicholas barrera) had a friend, emily (lyndsi larose), who was a housekeeper and was dating ernestos friend, carlos (carlos aviles). she told carlos that the man whose house she was cleaning has a giant safe thats sure to be holding valuables. scott agrees to help them with the robbery.luis picks up supplies for the break-in, and kurt steals a communication technicians uniform. that night, kurt climbs up a pole outside hanks house and blocks the electrical circuit, cutting off all phone communication. scott climbs the fence and takes out the window sensors, then pries open a window and heads to the basement. he unlocks the basement door only to find a second door that is fingerprint-coded. using tape, he lifts hanks print and opens that door. when he gets to the safe, he realizes that hell need some ingenuity to break the steel door. he drills small holes around the lock, then squirts in water and uses nitrogen to freeze it. the frozen water warps the steel and causes the bolts to shoot out. when he opens the safe, the only thing inside is a weird-looking body suit and helmet. he grabs that and heads out. meanwhile, hank has been watching the whole episode upstairs.dejected at not having gotten anything valuable, the group heads back to luis apartment. scott goes into the bathroom and examines the suit he stole, wondering why it was so heavily guarded. he notices tubes full of red and blue liquid. out of curiosity, he puts it on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror. noticing a red button on the glove, he pushes it and instantly shrinks, becoming a half-inch tall. luis comes into the bathroom and he turns on the water in the tub, which is like a tidal wave for tiny scott. he hears a voice coming from an earpiece in the helmet. he tries pushing a blue button to return to normal size, but its broken. panicked, he jumps away from the water and finds himself sailing across the room. he lands in a crack and falls through to the apartment below. in that room, theres a party going on, and scott realizes hes on a record player, with the needle moving toward him. he jumps free and lands on the floor where people are dancing. avoiding the giant footsteps, he gets under the door and into the hallway, where he is promptly sucked up into a vacuum cleaner. when the dust bag gets emptied, he jumps again, this time landing on a rat. he runs away, but lands on a mouse trap. when its triggered, it sends him flying out through a window and into the rainy night. he sees raindrops as big as his head, before landing on a car. the impact jarred the blue button free, and he grows back to normal size.scott races home and takes off the suit. realizing that someone had been tracking him all along, he decides to return the suit to hanks safe. he easily breaks into the house again and puts the suit back. but when he gets out, hes surrounded by cops. he is arrested and brought to prison, where paxton is waiting for him. gale tells paxton that scotts lawyer is there. confused, scott goes to see the lawyer that he hadnt asked for and doesnt know.the \"lawyer\" waiting for him is hank. he offers scott two choices, life in prison or follow his instructions. scott is thoroughly bewildered, so hank tells him that he allowed him to steal the suit. scott is taken back to his cell, and an army of ants brings him back the suit. he puts it on and shrinks, and then quickly escapes from the prison. one of hanks ants spreads its wings, and scott climbs on and flies over the city.hank tells scott that he invented the suit, but was afraid it would be misused, and so he had locked it away. darren had found out about the shrinking technology, but when hank wouldnt give it to him, darren forced hank out of pym tech. when hope realized how dangerous darren was, she teamed up with hank to stop him. hank tells scott that he needs him to become \"ant-man\" to stop people like darren. scott realizes he has a chance to become a true hero, the kind of father his daughter deserves.scott gets trained in martial arts and how to lead the ant colonies. he practices his timing with shrinking and growing back. hank tells him that one piece of technology hell need to steal the suit from darren is in an abandoned shield building. when scott flies to the building, he sees that its the current avengers headquarters. pressing forward, scott lands on the roof, triggering a sensor. sam wilson (anthony mackie) arrives to investigate, and he can see scott even at small size. a battle ensues, with scott going inside falcons jetpack and causing it to short out. scott escapes with the equipment he needs.when scott returns, hank explains the truth about how hopes mother died. there was an icbm that had been launched at the u.s., and hank was trying to stop it, but even at ant-size, he couldnt get inside. she had a similar suit, called the wasp. she decided to shrink to sub-atomic size and was able to stop the missile, but she couldnt return from that size and was lost in the quantum realm.darren cross finally has success at shrinking a lamb. he envisions himself taking over pym tech. he invites hank to the grand unveiling, then calls hope and tells her that he has increased security, including covering all the vents with microscopic mesh. they realize the job will be harder than they thought, and theyll need more people. luis, kurt and dave are brought in. luis poses as a security guard and lowers the water pressure so scott can get in through the pipes. scott plants explosives throughout the building, but when he tries to steal the suit, he gets caught in a glass cage by darren, who had anticipated the burglary. darren plans to sell the technology to hydra. scott breaks free and takes out the hydra agents. darren gets into a chopper on the roof and escapes just before the building blows up. hank and hope break out by turning a tiny tank to full-size, and ride it out the side of the building.darren puts on the yellow jacket suit, and he and scott fight inside the helicopter. after they both fall out, scott is able to trap darren inside a bug zapper, but jim paxton shows up to arrest him before he can destroy the suit. darren goes to jim and cassies house and threatens their lives, hoping to draw scott in. scott arrives and they fight. the only way scott can get inside darrens suit is to shrink to sub-atomic size, and he causes darren to shrink into nothing. lang is trapped in the quantum realm, but hearing cassies voice, he manages to rewire the suit, reversing the process and returning him to normal size. following the battle, a grateful paxton covers for scott so he would not have to go back to prison. hank wonders if hopes mother is also still alive somewhere. luis tells scott that the falcon is looking for him.hank shows hope a new version of the wasp suit, and tells her that it was made for her. captain america (chris evans) and falcon have trapped the winter soldier (sebastian stan), and are trying to figure out what to do next. they decide not to tell iron man, and falcon says he knows who to contact.][\"in 1991, bucky barnes (sebastian stan), brainwashed to be the winter soldier, causes a car to crash and recovers bags of a serum that turns people into super soldiers.after the avengers defeated ultron, thor and hulk are nowhere to be found. hawkeye (jeremy renner) has gone home to spend time with his family. even iron man (robert downey jr.) has apparently disengaged. captain america (chris evans) and black widow (scarlett johansson) are leading a new team of avengers, consisting of scarlet witch (elizabeth olsen), vision (paul bettany), war machine (don cheadle) and falcon (anthony mackie). but the world hasnt forgotten the numerous civilian casualties that resulted from the avengers previous missions.in lagos, nigeria, the team is tracking the movements of brock rumlow (frank grillo), a hydra agent who had infiltrated s.h.i.e.l.d. until captain america exposed him. brock was on one of the three helicarriers that cap had caused to fire on each other over the triskelion near washington dc, and he managed to survive the resulting crash. badly burned in the incident, he now he wears a skull mask and goes by the name crossbones. in lagos, crossbones and his team of mercenaries ram a garbage truck into the institute for infectious disease building and clear out the guards with smoke canisters. crossbones uses hydraulic gauntlets to give him super strength, and pounds open the glass around the lab. he grabs a vial containing a deadly, highly contagious virus. caps team takes out some of the mercenaries, and crossbones and the rest of the men make their escape in a truck. after a chase, the truck is taken out of action. crossbones hands the vial to one of his men, and tells them all to scatter. he then engages cap, repeatedly punching him with enhanced strength, while the rest of the team chases after the mercenaries. falcon finds the one holding the vial and shoots him, with black widow grabbing the vial before it hits the ground. cap gets the upper hand on crossbones, pinning him against the wall. crossbones tells him that bucky barnes remembers him. with cap momentarily distracted, crossbones pushes a button, triggering a bomb on his vest. cap braces himself, but scarlet witch is able to contain the force of the explosion. she uses her powers to push it up into the air, but shes only able to elevate it a bit before she loses control, and the explosion rips into the seventh floor of a nearby hotel. cap calls for fire and rescue, and then runs into the building to help evacuate. wanda tearfully looks at the destruction, devastated at her misguided actions.in a theater inside tony starks old college, a video plays of him and his parents, howard (john slattery) and maria. at the end, tony tells the students that he is starting the howard and maria stark foundation, and each one of them has been approved for a research grant. in a corridor, a woman confronts him and shows him a picture of her son, who had been killed in sokovia, crushed by a building that the avengers had knocked down.at the avengers headquarters, the team is watching news footage of the lagos mission. the reporter says that eleven people were killed in the hotel. steve tells them that he let his guard down, and people died because of it. vision tells steve that tony has arrived, and he brought the secretary of state as a guest. general thaddeus ross (william hurt) had been involved in the experiment that turned bruce banner into the hulk, and then had spent years trying to hunt him down. ross tells them that some people look up to them as heroes, but others think theyre vigilantes. he shows pictures of the destruction that follows the team wherever they go. then he sets a thick document down on the table and tells them its the sokovia accords, ratified by 117 countries. the accords state that the avengers will operate under a panels supervision, only acting when the panel decides its necessary. he says there will be a meeting in vienna in three days, and if they dont sign on, theyll have to retire.the team spends hours debating whether to agree to the accords, and tony shows them all a picture of the boy who was killed in sokovia. steve asks what will happen if theres somewhere they need to go but the panel wont allow them. tony replies that if they dont agree to this now, it will be forced on them later. knowing that theyve reached a stalemate, steve leaves in disgust. he gets a message that peggy carter has died and attends her funeral in london. at the memorial service, shield agent 13 (emily vancamp) reveals during her eulogy that shes carters niece, sharon. she and steve share a moment after the service where its hinted that they are romantically attracted to each other but they need to keep their friendship professional. the next day, natasha finds steve and tells him that she, tony, james rhodes and vision had signed on, with clint and wanda holding out.in vienna, several heads of state have gathered for the ratification of the accords. natasha meets the prince of wakanda, tchalla (chadwick boseman), and his father, king tchaka (john kani). wakanda had become abundant in vibranium, the material that was used to make captain americas shield, after a meteorite crashed there. additionally, some of the lagos victims were from wakanda. king tchaka takes the podium for the keynote address, and natasha notices security personnel surrounding a van parked outside. an explosion rips through the building, killing the king.back in the u.s., steve is sitting in a hotel room with sam and sharon carter when a news report comes in, showing the destruction in vienna. security footage shows the man who planted the bomb, and steve realizes that its bucky. sharon gets a text, and tells steve that she has to go to work, and takes a military plane to vienna. natasha looks around and sees hundreds of injured people. prince tchalla picks up a printed photo showing bucky leaving the van that had the bomb. natasha calls steve, and he tells her that he has to be the one to bring in bucky. he hangs up and looks at the damaged building, having already arrived in vienna. sharon sees him, and she hands him a file so he can get a head start on the manhunt, ahead of a german military task force, gsg9, who have orders to shoot to kill.in bucharest, bucky picks up a newspaper and sees that he is being accused of the bombing in vienna. he realizes that hell have to leave quickly. steve goes to buckys apartment and finds him there. the gsg9 storm in, and bucky blocks their bullets with caps shield and the two fight them off. he jumps down to the street, where he is confronted by the black panther, who scrapes his armor with metal claws on his hands. cap jumps down and lands next to them, and all three take fire from the gsg9. cap and bucky run for cover, but the black panther stands still, letting the bullets hit him and bounce off harmlessly. bucky runs through the streets with black panther chasing him, and cap and falcon following the panther. cap commandeers a gsg9 suv, while the panther leaps from the top of one car to the next, steadily gaining on bucky. bucky knocks a man off a motorcycle, then jumps on himself and guns the engine, driving into a tunnel. black panther is still tirelessly giving chase. cap drives the suv near buckys motorcycle, and the panther jumps onto the suvs roof, and then onto the back of the motorcycle. bucky swings backward, knocking the panther off, but he sticks his claws into the side of the suv and clings to its side. bucky looks ahead and sees falcon flying straight toward him. he hits the brakes, and turns the motorcycle around and drives back past the suv. cap throws it into reverse, trying to keep up with bucky. the panther jumps into the air, and lands on falcons wings. bucky takes a metal ball and throws it up to the roof of the tunnel. it explodes, blowing a hole in the concrete. falcon uses his wings to shield himself, throwing off the panther, who went straight through the explosion, unharmed. bucky swerves to avoid a car, and falls off the bike. the panther jumps on him, swinging his claws at him. cap tackles the panther, and they trade blows, with the panthers claws leaving gashes in caps shield. war machine flies in through the hole, and the gsg9 surrounds them all and tells them to put their hands up. they are all arrested, and black panther removes his mask, revealing himself as prince tchalla of wakanda.on the ride to the task force headquarters in berlin, cap tells the prince that he has the wrong man. cap, falcon and the prince get out, and in another truck, bucky is taken out in a cage. they are met by everett ross (martin freeman), the leader of the headquarters. the men have their weapons removed, and they are led inside the building, where black widow is waiting for them. everett takes prince tchalla into one room, and the others are led to another room, where tony tells them that secretary ross wants to have them all prosecuted. tony says that as a compromise, they wont get back the shield and wings, which are now government property.tchalla uses his influence to have bucky extradited to wakanda, where he will face charges of terrorism. bucky is given an evaluation to determine his mental state. still in the room with tony, cap watches it unfold. tony tells him that if he signs the accords now, bucky will be transferred to an american psych facility instead of a wakandan jail. steve agrees, but only if safeguards are put into place. tony brightens, telling steve that he and wanda will be reinstated. steve asks what he means about wanda, and he tells steve that she is being confined to the avengers upstate new york facility, under the guard of vision. tony says its the best he can do, since shes not a u.s. citizen and they wont give her a visa. steve says that shes only a kid, and doesnt deserve to be imprisoned. he leaves without signing onto the accords.hawkeye breaks into the facility where vision is holding scarlet witch. he attacks vision, but is unable to hurt him. scarlet witch uses her powers to vision through the floor and down several levels, and she and hawkeye escape.colonel zemo (daniel brühl), having already killed a hydra agent and recovered a book containing a list of words that will trigger buckys reversion to his brainwashed state, infiltrates the compound as the psychiatrist who will evaluate bucky and reads off the list. bucky, recognizing the trigger list, is helpless to stop zemo and pounds his way out of his cell, battling stark, cap, natasha and tchalla. he tries to escape in a helicopter on the roof but is stopped by rogers, who forces the chopper to fall into the river. he rescues his friend and takes him to a safe house where he and sam wilson clamp buckys bionic arm in an industrial press. regaining his senses, bucky tells steve that zemo is going to siberia, where there are several more super soldiers waiting for someone to wake them up and give them a mission.cap assembles a team consisting of bucky, falcon, hawkeye, scarlet witch and ant-man (paul rudd) to stop zemo. by operating outside of authority, they all become renegades. iron man forms his own team, made up of war machine, black panther, black widow, vision and spider-man (tom holland) to arrest the others. two teams meet at the airport in stuttgart, germany. caps plan involves stealing the quinjet some members of the other team arrived in. stark tries to appeal to rogers but fails and a pitched battle breaks out. stark insists that peter parker remain at a distance and use his webbing to subdue anyone he can. black panther intends to capture bucky. ant-man enlarges himself to 80 feet in height, distracting starks team and buying time for cap and bucky to escape to an aircraft hangar. black widow appears intent on stopping them, but she turns on black panther, allowing cap and bucky to fly off in the quinjet. war machine tries to stop them from escaping, but falcon flies after him. tony orders vision to stop falcon, vision shoots an energy beam which falcon dodges and it hits war machine instead, causing him to fall from the sky and impact the ground before either falcon or stark can reach him. stark finds that rhodes is barely alive. when falcon tries to express his sympathy, tony knocks him out with a repulsor blast.after seeing evidence that bucky was framed for the vienna explosion, iron man travels to the raft, a remote arctic prison facility where the other members of caps team are incarcerated under the supervision of secretary ross. tony is able to temporarily block the audio surveillance system of the facility long enough to show sam that rogers was right and that zemo had killed the psychiatrist who was supposed to evaluate bucky. he is able to find out from sam wilson where rogers and bucky went. tony boards his private chopper and slips out in his iron man armor and heads to siberia to meet up with cap and bucky and make peace.once tony finds bucky and capt, they find that the super soldiers have already been killed, and zemo, hidden behind indestructible glass, reveals that his real plan was to find footage of the winter soldiers first mission. black panther had been following, unseen, and he hears zemo admit responsibility for the explosion. zemo shows them a videotape of bucky causing the car crash, and then murdering the occupants, howard and maria stark, in cold blood.incensed, iron man attacks both cap and bucky, and he demands to know if steve knew what had happened. steve tells him that he only knew that hydra was behind his parents murder. they fight, and iron man blasts off buckys metal arm. cap eventually disables tonys arc reactor, rendering his suit useless. tony tells him that he doesnt deserve to carry his shield that his father gave to steve. steve drops it and leaves with bucky. zemo is sitting outside, and black panther stands behind him. he tells black panther that his family was killed in zokovia, and he wouldnt stop until he destroyed the avengers from within. with his success, zemo tries to commit suicide with a gun, but black panther places his hand over the barrel, stopping the bullet, and then apprehends zemo for judgment.tony is helping rhodes with his recovery, giving him robotic leg braces to recover from paralysis. steve breaks the heroes out of their island prison and they go to wakanda, where tchalla gives them asylum. bucky elects to be put back into cryogenic sleep until they can find a way to cure his brainwashing, so that no one will be able to manipulate him again. peter parker is recovering from his injuries at home, and he tries out a new version of the web shooter that tony gave him. it projects the spidey signal onto the ceiling.\"][\"a sorcerer, later revealed to be kaecilius (mads mikkelsen), tears some pages from a chained book in a old, seemingly gothic library. his minions restrain the librarian/guardian with bands of energy. kaecilius uses two large knives to decapitate the man and escapes with the help of several followers. the owner of the book, whom we later meet as the ancient one (tilda swinton), goes after them. as he flees, kaecilius bends, folds, and reshapes the streets and buildings of the city (think inception (2010), but more kaleidoscopic). though shes a formidable magical fighter, the ancient one is unable to pin down kaecilius and he escapes.dr. steven strange (benedict cumberbatch) is cool and confident as he performs a delicate brain operation. as he finishes, dr. christine palmer (rachel mcadams) rushes in to show him an x-ray of a patient with a bullet in his brain. he immediately dismisses the case as hopeless but with further prodding from christine, he realizes that the patient is comatose because his medulla oblongata has been poisoned by trace elements in the bullet. strange realizes he can save the mans life and goes to the er surgery and quickly does a manual extraction with forceps, demonstrating his impressive hand control. the doctor who made the initial diagnosis, nicodemus west (michael stuhlbarg) is left humiliated by stranges overwhelming ego. later, strange and christine joke about their on-again, off-again relationship. she turns down his request to join him that evening.strange dresses for the evening in his expensive condo, pausing to choose from a drawer full of high-end watches. speeding out of his condo in his lamborghini huracán, strange heads north. he calls an assistant to consider his next patients; hes in high demand but he wants only difficult, interesting cases. distracted and driving recklessly, he crashes and the car plunges into the river. as his car is wrecked, his hands slam into the dashboard.he is airlifted back to his hospital and christine is there when he awakens, badly hurt. his hands have had to be rebuilt and are immobilized in a framework of pins and wires. recovering slowly after further surgeries, his hands remain stiff and shaky -- he can no longer work as a neurosurgeon. feeling sorry for himself, strange breaks up with christine. he hears about a man called jonathan pangborn (benjamin bratt) who, inexplicably, recovered from a half-body paralysis. strange finds pangborn playing basketball and the man tells him he found the cure in kamar-taj.strange makes his way to nepal and wanders the streets of kathmandu. he is noticed and followed. mordo (chiwetel ejiofor) saves him from muggers and takes him to kamar-taj, where he meets the ancient one.she knows all about strange and introduces him to an alternate reality where many hidden universes and dimensions can be harnessed for power and mystical guidance. he begins training and slowly learns to open gates to jump across the world. he learns the temple is part of a secret group saving the world from enemies in other dimensions and universes. while training, mordo shows strange a magic stick, a relic that can be used as a weapon and says relics must choose their user. he explains that kaecilius, a former student of the ancient one, has stolen a spell from a book and escaped with three zealots; there is worry he will decipher the spell and call in dormammu from the dark dimension to take over the world. strange is upset and says he hasnt come to join their group, only to cure his hands.strange visits kamar-tajs library, which is kept by wong (benedict wong). strange becomes a voracious student, borrowing and reading many books from the humorless wong. when he asks about the book that kaecilius was after, wong explains that its reserved for use only by the sorceror supreme and its the one that kaecilius stole pages from. when strange masters creating portals, he steals more books from the library and learns about astral projection. one night when wong appears to be out of the library, strange learns how to use a time-shifting pendant, the eye of agamotto, which enables him to see the missing page from the book. mordo and wong tell him it is forbidden to use time spells as they can cause time loops that a wielder can be stuck in forever and also let evil forces into their universe.wong explains that are three sanctums, in london, new york, and hong kong, where the group watches out for the world. he also gives more of dormammus history, that he is a purely evil being bent on conquering all the known worlds and that earth has long been his ultimate target.kaecilius finally deciphers the stole spell and his group attacks the london sanctum, a plain building with a logo window. the backlash from the london sanctum throws strange through a door and into the new york sanctum. the building is deserted as he wanders the floors looking at various artifacts. he notices a burgundy cloak in a glass case that moves as he looks at it. at the end of a corridor he finds three glass doors that turn out to be gateways to other places; the destination is changed by turning a dial next to each door.kaecilius and his group attack the new york sanctum. strange develops fighting skills on the fly. he gets rid of two zealots using the gateways and the burgundy cloak, a relic which seems to have some intelligence and wraps itself around him. the cloak helps him subdue the third zealot and restrain kaecilius in an antique binding rack. strange and kaecilius have a talk about the ancient one and immortality in which kaecilius claims that the ancient one has achieved her long life using powers from the dark dimension. once strange lets down his guard the third zealot revives and stabs him. strange manages to open a gate and stagger into a cleaners closet in christines hospital. he finds her and barely manages to get on a table as christine hooks him to a heart monitor and performs and emergency pericardiocentesis to drain excess blood from around his heart. meanwhile, strange separates his astral body and continues to fight the zealot, finally killing him with the help of christine, who shocks him with a defibrillator, killing the zealot. the zealot isnt visible to christine, but she can tell something is going on and shes very spooked. sewn up and recovering, strange tells christine he must return and goes back through the gate.kaecilius has escaped and mordo joins strange in new york. the ancient one also comes and suggests strange take over the new york sanctum. theyre impressed the magical cape, known as the cloak of levitation, has chosen him. however, strange is reluctant to take the position until they tell him more about kaecilius and also about the ancient ones use of dark magic to prolong her life.kaecilius returns with more zealots and strange creates a mirror dimension to contain the fight, which spills out into the street. kaecilius uses his powers to shape-shift the city (as he did in the opening scene when he fought the ancient one) and disorient strange. the ancient one returns to help but she falls and is mortally wounded. strange takes her to christines hospital but it is too late. strange follows the ancient ones spirit in his astral form and they talk overlooking new york city. she accepts this is her end and suggests strange can take over.back in the new york sanctum, strange and mordo realize hong kong is next on kaecilius list. they gate over but the hong kong sanctum has been overrun and the destructive force is enveloping the city. wong, who was guarding it, is dead and dormammus dark dimension is growing from the location of the sanctum. strange uses the eye of agamotto to start reversing the process but kaecilius recovers and manages to stun strange, stopping the process before it can complete . strange thinks of something and flies off into the heart of the dormammus dark dimension. here, he confronts dormammu and manages to create an infinite time loop: dormammu kills strange in various ways but time is always reset to the moment strange first confronted him. dormammu is furious but finally agrees to leave earth alone in return for strange stopping the time loop. back on the street, strange sends kaecilius and his crew into the dark dimension just before it vanishes.mordo is upset that strange broke the rules in using the time pendant and that the ancient one used what he considers to be forbidden powers to prolong her life. before she died, the ancient one warned strange that mordo was very big on following the rules -- both his weakness and his strength -- and that stranges flexibility would be an important factor when they worked together. but mordo says there must be a reckoning and he retires from the group and walks away.strange takes over the new york sanctum. he puts the eye of agamotto back in its guarded place at kamar-taj, where wong tells him its an infinity stone.sometime later dr. strange sits with thor and agrees to help him find odin and rid earth of thors scheming brother, loki.mordo visits pangborn and takes back the magic repairing his back. pangborn collapses. mordo says the problem is too many sorcerers on earth.\"][missouri, planet earth, 1980meredith quill (laura haddock) is riding in a car, listening to tunes on the radio with her boyfriend (kurt russell), whom she calls her \"spaceman\". they go behind a dairy queen and run into the woods where the man shows meredith a small alien seedling, which he says will eventually be all over the place. he then kisses meredith.34 years later.the guardians of the galaxy, peter quill/star-lord (chris pratt), gamora (zoe saldana), drax (dave bautista), rocket raccoon (voice of bradley cooper), and baby groot (voice of vin diesel) are standing on a platform as they try to secure anulax batteries from their latest employers, the sovereigns. the guardians have their weapons ready as they gear up to battle an interdimensional beast known as the abilisk. the abilisk descends, leading the guardians to spring into action, except for groot, who is jamming out to \"mr. blue sky\" on a speaker that rocket set up, all while the others are trying to annihilate the abilisk. drax ends up falling on the speaker, to groots dismay. since they cannot harm the abilisk from the outside, drax tries to kill it from inside by allowing it to swallow him. star-lord notices a cut on the monsters neck and orders rocket to get it to look up. gamora then slices the abilisk downward, killing it and letting drax spill out of the hole.the guardians bring the batteries back to the sovereigns and meet with their high priestess, ayesha (elizabeth debicki). in exchange for the batteries, the sovereigns deliver gamoras sister nebula (karen gillan) to the guardians so that they can take her to xandar and collect the bounty for her. before they leave, ayesha talks down to the guardians, but peter in particular, noting his half-human/half-alien heritage gives him something she deems reckless. the guardians leave, with rocket swiping some of the batteries for himself.on their way to the planet xandar, the guardians are suddenly met by a fleet of sovereign drones, all going after them for the stolen batteries. the others figure it was rocket that took them, and theyre all pissed off. the drones start attacking as rocket tries to steer the milano toward a wormhole that will lead them to another planet. in the distance, another craft passes by and starts to destroy the sovereign drones. a man appears to stand on his ship and wave to the guardians. the guardians escape the drones but must crash-land on a nearby planet.as the guardians observe the wreckage of their ship, the other ship that saved them descends. stepping out is ego, who reveals himself to be peters father. with him is his empathic assistant mantis (pom klementieff).on another planet, yondu udonta (michael rooker) and his team of ravagers have fallen on hard times. he is staying in a nearby hotel (where howard the duck is also in attendance). yondu spots his old comrade stakar ogord (sylvester stallone), who has exiled yondu from the ravager team for child trafficking. among the ravagers is taserface (chris sullivan), who thinks the ravagers need a new leader, along with kraglin (sean gunn), who has since also come to question yondus leadership. after yondu finishes talking to stakar, the sovereigns arrive, and ayesha approaches yondu with a proposition.peter is still in shock to finally be meeting his father. ego explains that he sent yondu to pick peter up after his mother died. peter still also doesnt understand why ego left meredith in the first place. he invites peter and his friends to his planet, which peter is hesitant about until gamora convinces him to join his father. peter, gamora, and drax go with ego and mantis while rocket and groot stay behind to fix the milano and keep an eye on nebula.on egos ship, the three talk to mantis, who shows off her powers by seeing into their minds. she lets everyone know that peter has sexual feelings for gamora, which drax finds hilarious.the ravagers come across the woods where the guardians crash-landed. most of them end up walking into traps laid out by rocket until yondu shows up with his yaka arrow controlled through his whistling. the ravagers get rocket and groot, but when taserface plans to get peter, yondu isnt quite as willing to turn him over. nebula then breaks the crest on yondus head to knock him out. she aligns herself with the ravagers as they take rocket, groot, and yondu prisoner.ego brings everyone to the planet that literally lives through him, as ego is a celestial and his consciousness is the core of the planet. he explains to the three that he came up with a human form to travel the galaxy and he came to earth and fell in love with meredith, but could not see her so often because it would take up a lot of his energy. peter continues to hold hostile feelings for ego for leaving meredith alone to die. as peter grows more emotional, his hands produce powerful energy that is linked to egos own power. ego shows him how to control and use it.on the ravager ship, taserface and his goons start ejecting those that are still loyal to yondu, except for kraglin, who only watches in disbelief as his friends are killed. when taserface boasts of his greatness and \"fearful\" name, rocket only mocks him. nebula enters and suggests that the ravagers turn in their captives to the kree for the bounties on their heads. she also makes other demands, including a new hand. kraglin brings her to a ship that she uses to get off the ravager ship and to go find gamora.mantis and drax form a bond, though drax continues to remind mantis that he finds her hideous, but that it is a good thing because he thinks he is hideous as well and still managed to find someone else that loved him for who he is. mantis says that she needs to tell drax something important, but gamora interrupts things and mantis keeps quiet, instead just taking the two to their rooms.the ravagers throw rocket and yondu in a cell while they take groot for their own entertainment. yondu mentions how he was kree battle slave before stakar pulled him out and made him a ravager. when rocket asks about why yondu kept peter around, he insists its because peter was small enough to fit in spaces where the others couldnt. the two then resolve to work together to break out of there. they get groot to come by, and yondu tells him to get a prototype fin for his head. after bringing a bunch of wrong items, yondu gets his fin and gets himself and rocket out. yondu sends the arrow through every mutinous ravager they come across, which rocket and groot get in on some ravager ass-kicking themselves. the three board an escape ship with kraglin, but not before yondu sets the whole ship to blow up. taserface gets hit with flames, but he manages to notify ayesha to yondus whereabouts before he goes down with the ship. the other four must go through 700 jumps to get to egos planet.back on egos planet, peter tries to woo gamora with his dance moves, but it doesnt quite work as she cannot bring herself to express her own attraction to him. after she leaves, gamora then sees nebula coming down on her ship, shooting at gamora. as nebula crash-lands, she jumps out to start fighting gamora. nebula manages to overpower gamora but reveals that she never wanted to prove she was better than her, just that she wanted to have a real sister. gamoras success as a warrior led to their father thanos mutilating nebula, leading to her resentment of gamora. the two then form a sort-of alliance as they come across a cavern filled with about a hundred skeletons.peter and ego continue to bond. ego tells peter that as long as there is light in the planet, peter will retain his powers, as well as immortality. mantis sees that ego has peter wrapped around his finger now that he knows about his own powers. she rushes to wake up drax to warn him that egos true intentions are now clear.rocket, groot, yondu, and kraglin make it to their destination. rocket starts to gloat that he wants to save peter just to prove hes better than him and can hang it over his head, but yondu shuts rocket up by stating how scared rocket really is and how he puts on the tough guy thing as a facade. they then set off to take on ego.ego explains to peter that he wants to make what he calls \"the expansion\". he went around the galaxy to thousands of other worlds to plant the seedlings to grow his power over the galaxy and cover the planets in an extension of himself. he impregnated women from those worlds and produced many children that yondu delivered to him, but when they did not possess the same power of a celestial, ego had them killed, and now their bones are what gamora and nebula found. peter just so happens to hold the power that ego was looking for. ego also reveals that he put the tumor that killed meredith in her head so that he would not feel the pain of being apart from her. peter snaps out of it and begins to unload his guns on ego in fury. in response, ego takes peter and controls him to start spreading the seedlings across the planets, causing mass destruction. to top it off, ego crushes peters walkman and awesome mix volume 2 that his mother left him.rocket, groot, and yondu meet up with gamora, drax, nebula, and mantis as they gear up to stop ego. unfortunately, they are also met by a fleet of sovereigns out to kill them as well. peter fights egos human form, but his entire planet self fights back. mantis is able to put ego to sleep while the guardians take care of the others. they fight back against the sovereigns and eventually destroy their whole fleet with a bunch of lasers. meanwhile, rocket builds a bomb using the batteries he stole, which groot takes and runs off with, despite rocket warning him not to push the wrong button or else theyll all die. mantis gets knocked out by a fireball, breaking her hold on ego and reawakening him. as the others try to get safe, ego begins to consume them. peter continues fighting his father using his celestial powers. now freed, groot then finds egos brain in the planets core, and he sets the bomb to go off in five minutes.drax carries mantis to the ship while gamora and nebula make it back. rocket gives his last spacesuit to yondu, knowing he cannot save both him and peter. gamora tries to go back, but rocket stops her so he doesnt lose another friend. ego pleads with peter to stop the bomb, or else peter will just be a normal human. peter sees nothing wrong with that and lets the bomb go off. egos human form disintegrates as the rest of the planet starts to explode. yondu flies by and grabs peter. as they leave the planets atmosphere, yondu puts the suit on peter to save him. he tells peter that while ego was his father, he was never his daddy. yondu then starts to freeze up in space, and peter sadly watches him die.the guardians prepare to give yondu a proper ravager funeral. kraglin gives peter a zune to make up for his lost walkman, which yondu had been meaning to give him for a while. in return, peter gives kraglin yondus arrow, feeling that yondu would have wanted him to take it. nebula sets off to hunt thanos down herself, but not before reconciling with gamora. mantis decides to stay with the guardians. as yondus body goes out into space, the guardians see dozens of other ravager ships arriving to pay their respects to yondu.there are five end credits scenes that follow:kraglin tries to practice using the arrow. he doesnt quite get the hang of it, and he ends up sticking drax with it.nstakar honors yondus sacrifice by forming his own team with martinex tnaga (michael rosenbaum), charlie-27 (ving rhames), starhawk (michelle yeoh), and mainframe (miley cyrus).ayesha and another sovereign discuss their new plan to take down the guardians. we see ayesha sitting by a birthing pod, waiting to break out whatever is inside to use against the guardians. she decides to call it \"adam\" (as in, adam warlock).groot is now a teenager. peter scolds him for leaving his roots lying around, but groot just mocks him and plays video games.the elderly stan lee, in his obligatory cameo, is sitting with the watchers, discussing his previous adventures, but they become bored and leave him.][the film opens in new york city the avengers battled the chitauri. salvage worker adrian toomes (michael keaton) is showing his co-worker a drawing that his daughter made of the avengers in action. they proceed to work on taking apart the chitauri leviathan and gathering any tech they can get their hands on. soon, a van from the u.s. department of damage control arrives. anne marie hoag (tyne daly) orders toomes to shut down his operation, and adds that they will be confiscating all of their findings. toomes protests and even punches a damage control agent when he makes a snide remark to him. hoag then reasserts her demand to toomes to give up his work.after learning that tony stark (robert downey, jr.) is behind damage control, toomes gathers three of his co-workers - jackson brice (logan marshall-green), herman schultz (bokeem woodbine), and phineas mason (michael chernus) - to continue their work in gathering chitauri tech regardless of what they are told. eight years later, toomes and his guys are still at it, with toomes using his vulture suit to bring in a bag of chitauri power core.meanwhile, peter parker (tom holland) is recording a video log as he travels to berlin with happy hogan (jon favreau) for what is really tony recruiting peter to help him during the events of \"civil war\". happy shows off the new spider-man suit that tony made for peter, which he gets super excited about. he later records his fight alongside iron man and everyone on his loyalist side during the airport fight against captain america and the other avengers. tony then brings peter home in his limo, leaving him eager for their next mission.two months later, peter is still waiting to hear back from happy over any new missions. he goes back to being a normal student at midtown high school. peter makes plans with his best friend ned (jacob batalon) to build a lego death star. peter also has a crush on a senior named liz (laura harrier) and is frequently taunted by snotty rich kid flash thompson (tony revolori). when not at school, peter continues going around the city as spider-man to help people as well as fight crime. peter refers to his spidey work as the stark internship, and as a result, he quits his schools decathlon team. while at school, peter secretly creates new web fluid for his shooters.one night, spidey catches four crooks with avengers masks trying to rob a bank using high-tech equipment. spidey shows up and fights the criminals, until one of them uses a device that emits a powerful blast, blowing up not only the bank, but also the bodega across the street. spidey rushes over to save the owner of the bodega (and his cat).peter quietly returns to his room through his window while not trying to let aunt may (marisa tomei) know that he was out. he crawls across the ceiling and comes down to find ned sitting on his bed, holding the completed lego death star. he drops it and it breaks upon neds discovery that peter is spider-man. ned is shocked but also thrilled. peter forces him to keep it a secret.peter later goes with may to dinner. may is trying to get the silent peter, and peter admits that hes been tired out from the \"stark internship,\" with may admitting to not being a fan of stark. they see footage of the bank robbery, and may warns peter not to go anywhere near that type of chaos in the city.the entire next day at school, ned asks peter questions about being spider-man. they even watch a psa from captain america (chris evans) during gym, and peter briefly mentions fighting him. the boys then hear liz talking to her friends about how shes got kind of a crush on spider-man, leading ned to blurt out in front of everyone that peter knows spider-man. liz then invites peter and ned to a party at her house so that peter can try to invite spider-man.the boys attend the party, and almost instantly, ned tries to get peter to change into his spider-man outfit. peter doesnt want to until flash starts pestering him. he goes to change, but then sees an explosion in the distance. he goes to investigate and finds brice and schultz selling chitauri tech to a local gangster named aaron davis (donald glover). peters cell goes off when ned tries to call him, making brice and schultz think aaron was setting them up. spidey intervenes and tries to fight the crooks. he chases them until vulture swoops down and grabs spidey. he drops him into the river as he gets tangled in his parachute. iron man then comes down and saves spidey, finding out where he was because of a tracker in his suit. tony is not in the suit as he is basically calling peter, but he tells him to stay out of crime-fighting for his own good. peter considers returning to the party, but ned has him hear on the phone that flash has everyone mocking peter. peter then finds a weapon that one of the crooks left behind.at toomess lair, brice admits to dropping his weapon as he was using his electric gauntlets (calling himself \"shocker\"). fed up with brices carelessness, toomes cuts him from the team, but brice threatens to spill their secrets to toomes wife and the public. toomes responds by grabbing a powerful gun off masons desk and incinerating brice with it (mistaking an anti-gravity gun for a laser gun). he then gives schultz the gauntlets so he can be shocker.with neds help, peter cracks open the weapon to find a power core. he finds schultz again and places a tracker on him, discovering that he is going to maryland. to get there, peter rejoins the decathlon team as they head to d.c. for the nationals competition.peter sneaks out and goes to find schultz as spider-man. he catches the villains attempting to hijack a damage control truck with more weaponry inside. during his attempt to foil the villains, spidey is knocked unconscious and wakes up in a damage control warehouse, unable to leave because the door is sealed until the morning. peter talks to the a.i. system in his suit, whom he refers to as karen (jennifer connelly). she helps peter get a better understanding of how his suit works. he even tells her about his feelings for liz. he also learns that the power core is basically a bomb that will go off when exposed to radiation. when he realizes he is about to miss the competition, peter has karen help him unlock the doors as he rushes to the competition.peter misses the whole competition, but the team wins thanks to the help of reserved loner michelle jones (zendaya). the team then heads over to the washington monument. he calls ned to warn him about the power core that he was holding, but is unable to get the message through. as spidey, he rushes to the monument, but the core goes off in neds backpack as the team is riding up the elevator. spidey climbs up the monument to save the team, but he cant get in through the window without using great force. the police arrive in choppers and order spidey to get to the ground. against their orders, spidey leaps over the choppers and swings from the bottom. he breaks in and tries to hold the falling elevator with his web, but the weight pulls him down. he is able to hold the web and the elevator as everyone inside climbs out. liz is the last person and nearly falls with the elevator but spidey catches her with the web and rescues her.back in new york, karen reveals that the spider-man suit records everything that peter has seen. she gets a visual on aaron, and spidey later finds him in a parking garage. he attempts to interrogate him to find out why he was trying to get the tech from toomess goons. aaron says he was trying to get them out of his neighborhood. he figures that spidey is new to being a hero. aaron tells spidey that toomes is meeting to gather more tech at the staten island ferry later that afternoon.on the ferry, toomes is meeting with another criminal named mac gargan (michael mando). spidey gets a call from tony, but he lies about what hes up to. spidey spots schultz on the boat but sees toomes and doesnt realize he is vulture. he swings in and incapacitates gargan and his goons. toomes tries to use a weapon on spidey, but he holds it down with his webbing. this backfires since the weapon becomes unstable and splits the ferry in half. spidey then tries to hold the ferry together with his webbing, but its not strong enough and it continues to split. as spidey holds on as much as he can, iron man and his little drones show up to put the ferry back together and save everyone.spidey retreats to a rooftop. iron man finds him and chews him out for not listening to him and lying to him about what hes doing with the suit. peter then attempts to put the blame on tony for what happened with the ferry for not listening to him about the vulture, but tony steps out of his suit this time and reveals that he did in fact listen to peter, as he sent the fbi on the same ferry that toomes was on. he goes on to remind peter that, while nobody got harmed, if somebody did, it wouldve been on peter. feeling that hes unworthy of it, tony demands that peter give him back the spidey suit. peter pleads with tony, saying that hes nothing without the suit, to which tony says that he doesnt deserve it if hes nothing without it. peter is failed to convince tony to let him stay with the suit. he goes home to aunt may dejectedly. she gets on him for not answering his phone all day, even going to the police to find out where he was. she also knows about him skipping detention at school earlier that day, that he missed out on the decathlon competition in washington, and he sneaks out out of the house every night. demanding an explanation, he admits to getting fired from the internship.peter resumes his life as a student and spends more time with ned. peter finds liz at school and admits to liking her, which she already knew. he then asks her to the homecoming dance, which she accepts.on the night of the dance, peter goes to pick up liz, only to learn that her father is none other than...adrian toomes. after some awkward photos, toomes drives peter and liz to the dance. as liz tells adrian about peters background and the events at washington, he slowly starts putting together the pieces of peters circumstances and realizes that hes spider-man. liz leaves the car, and toomes quietly threatens peter by telling him to stay out of his business or else he will kill him and anyone he cares about.during the dance, peter learns that toomes plans to steal a shipment of weaponry from a plane coming from the avengers tower heading to their new headquarters. peter ditches liz and rushes to get his homemade spider-man suit to stop toomes. he heads outside and is attacked by schultz with his gauntlets. peter tries to reach his web shooter, but schultz continues to pummel him. he is saved by ned, and peter sticks schultz to a bus with the webbing.spidey rushes to stop toomes with ned being his eyes and ears. ned tries to get in touch with happy, but he doesnt care about it and hangs up on him. spidey finds toomes in his lair. toomes attempts to reason with peter that hes only doing what he believes is necessary and that the world isnt as black and white as the young peter believes it to be, but it turns out to be a distraction as toomes unleashes his suit as it flies around the area, destroying support beams and causing a pile of debris to fall on spidey. toomes leaves him to die. peter struggles to lift the rubble off of him and he fears he is going to die. he then remembers tonys words, he uses all his strength to pull himself out and hell have to do it all alone without tonys help.spidey latches onto vultures suit as he intercepts the plane. toomes tries to gather what he needs, but spidey foils his plan. toomes gets in his suit and fights spidey on the plane. they knock out the turbines, sending the plane toward coney island. spidey is able to maneuver the plane away from the city and onto the beach as it crash-lands. toomes attempts to get away with the weaponry, but spidey tries to warn him that they are about to explode. toomes tries flying away anyway, but the cores blow up and he goes crashing down. spidey finds toomes and saves him, but he leaves him next to the rest of the weaponry for happy and the police to find later, leading to toomes getting arrested.at school, peter finds out that liz is moving to oregon with her mother while her father is on trial. she is still upset with peter for leaving her at the dance. she says goodbye to peter and hopes that he can figure himself out. peter is back on the decathlon team, and michelle is made captain. she quickly mentions that her nickname is mj. peter then gets a text to go to the bathroom. happy is there, thanking peter for what he did. he then tells peter that tony wants to see him.tony and happy bring peter to the new avengers hq. tony presents peter with a brand new spider-man suit, telling him that there are reporters behind the wall waiting for a big announcement, meaning tony is about to officially make peter a new avenger. however, peter turns tony down, saying he prefers to be a \"friendly neighborhood spider-man\" for now. peter leaves, and asks tony if he was testing him and whether or not he passed, and tony seemingly confirms it adding that there are no reporters. however, tony is actually surprised that peter made the mature choice of turning him down, and that there really were a bunch of reporters outside. pepper potts (gwyneth paltrow) comes out, asking where peter is. she is frustrated that he walked out, so happy covers for them by giving tony a ring so he can propose to pepper.when peter gets home, he finds a bag from tony on his bed. tony is convinced and has given peter back the original spider-man suit. peter then proudly puts it on...not realizing aunt may is behind him, leading her to blurt out \"what the f--\".mid-credits scene: toomes is locked up at the raft and he runs into gargan, who mentions that he and other criminals are trying to come together to kill spider-man. gargan then reveals that he heard a rumor of toomes knowing who spider-man is. toomes denies it, saying spider-man would already be dead if he knew. he then leaves gargan to see liz and his wife visiting him.after-credits scene: captain america shows up in another psa talking about patience, and how sometimes being patient leads to things that arent worth it. he then asks the off-screen director of the psas how many more psa videos he has to work on.][\"the story opens about two years after the events in avengers: age of ultron. thor (chris hemsworth), having failed in his quest to locate the infinity stones and having also been dumped by jane (although he insists it was a mutual dumping) is hanging in chains above a fire pit before being brought before the monstrous fire demon surtur. surtur believes his destiny is to bring about ragnarok, the complete destruction of asgard. thor learns from surtur that odin (anthony hopkins) is not on asgard, so uses mjolnir (his hammer) to escape and destroy surtur, keeping his crown/skull, the demons power source. thor returns to asgard and sends surturs skull down to the vaults but then finds heimdall (idris elba) has been replaced as sentry of the bifrost bridge by the inept skurge (karl urban) who explains that odin accused heimdall of treachery. heimdall subsequently fled and his whereabouts are unknown.reaching asgard, thor sees a massive statue of loki (tom hiddleston) as well as odin lounging around, enjoying a play about lokis heroic sacrifice while fighting the dark elves. realizing whats happened, thor quickly forces loki (who usurped and disguised himself as odin prior to the end of thor: the dark world) to drop his charade and demands to know what happened to odin. it is revealed that loki had placed odin under a spell and dumped him in a retirement home in new york city. by the time they get there it is being demolished. before they can plan their next move, loki is suddenly pulled through a dimensional hole in the sidewalk and a card with an address (177a bleecker st) is left behind. thor goes there and finds doctor stephen strange (benedict cumberbatch), the mystic guardian of earth, who agrees to help him find odin on the condition that all asgardians leave earth. thor agrees, and after doing some research (during which thor is constantly teleported around stranges sanctum, a disorienting experience) doctor strange deduces that odin is in norway. he then releases loki from his endless fall, and when loki tries to attack an exasperated strange, the doctor unceremoniously sends them both through another portal.they find odin in norway sitting near a scenic cliff (having shaken off lokis spell) and he admits that he is dying and ragnarok is approaching. thor insists that when he destroyed surtur, he prevented ragnarok. odin mentions hela (cate blanchett), his true first-born child, the goddess of death and the one who will seize asgard from odins sons. odin tells thor and loki that their (previously unknown) sister was completely consumed by darkness and was sealed away, the only force that continues her exile is odin himself. he apologizes to thor for failing him before dying and disappearing. as soon as hes gone, hela emerges from her prison and engages the two in brief small talk. seeing that she wont be reasoned with, thor throws mjolnir towards her however the goddess easily catches and effortlessly shatters the long-indestructable weapon. loki, seeing they dont stand a chance, asks to be returned to asgard via the bifrost, however hela also enters the portal, expels loki and then thor from it at different points and reaches asgard. arriving at the bifrost bridge, she quickly kills volstagg (ray stevenson) and fendral (zachary levi) before recruiting a terrified skurge to her cause. she then heads to asgard when she kills the entire palace guard single-handedly as well as hogun (tadanobu asano).thor is deposited by the portal on a planet, sakaar, which seems to consist entirely of gigantic garbage mounds, fed by giant portals in the skies. hes attacked by several scavengers. now weapon-less, he is quickly overpowered before his attackers are scared off by the hard-drinking bounty hunter valkyrie (tessa thompson). however she then captures thor, placing a small shocking device on his neck to pacify him, and takes him to the grandmaster (jeff goldblum) who is delighted with his newest acquisition and decides to put him up against his champion fighter. thor learns that loki is also present and has been there for weeks (time moving far quicker on the grandmasters planet) during which he has found favor with the grandmaster. not wishing to jeopardize his position, loki pretends not to care about his brother and thor is thrown in the dungeons where he befriends rock-creature korg who explains that all who have gone up against the champion have been killed. meanwhile, hela enters asgards throne room and pulls down the fresco above the throne depicting odin and the royal family and their benevolent rule of their kingdom and the universe, revealing the darker history of asgard where odin and hela conquered the nine realms before she was banished by her father. hela then heads down to asgards vaults and uses asgards eternal flame to restore her entire army and revive her monstrous wolf, fenris. (she also dismisses the infinity gauntlet that is kept there as a fake). she then attempts to open a portal and conquer all the realms but the bifrost sword has been taken by heimdall who has been hiding in the hills and is now sheltering the escaping civilians from asgard.thor is taken to the arena and put up against the champion who is revealed to be none other than the incredible hulk. thor is overjoyed to see his old teammate, however the hulk attacks him. the two bash each other around the area, thor gaining the upper hand. he tries using natasha romanovs calming technique to make him transform back into bruce banner (mark ruffalo) however it doesnt work and hulk thrashes him (loki is very unsettled to again see the creature that gave him a sound beating during his attempted conquest of earth). eventually thor stops holding back and begins to fight, at one point having a vision of odin causing him to channel raw lightning. however just when he is about to win the grandmaster, not wanting to see a crowd (and his own) favorite be beaten, shocks thor into submission. as the hulk leaps into the air to crush thor, thor puts his hand up in defense before everything goes black.on asgard, hela has the remaining people rounded up and demands to know where the bifrost sword is. when no-one comes forward, hela tells skurge to execute a random person. skurge hesitates, but is still about to do it, but before he can make the kill someone comes forward with heimdalls location.thor wakes up later in the hulks chamber, being pampered by several beautiful women. thor speaks to hulk privately (hulk is now able to speak far more intelligently than he was able to in his last appearance) and learns that he hasnt transformed back into banner since leaving earth two years earlier. the hulk points out that the quinjet he left earth with is still in one piece and could be used to escape. he also learns that valkyrie is an asgardian who was part of an elite all-female group who were sent up against hela during her previous assault but were all killed (valkyrie being the only survivor). thor tries to convince her to help, but she initially refuses. although hulk is happy in his life and wants to stay, he does help thor acquire the control device for his electronic restraint -- thor pickpockets it from valkyrie and removes the shocker from his neck. thor escapes from hulks apartment and reaches the quinjet, but is chased by hulk who smashes it half apart. however thor then plays black widows (scarlett johansson) last message to him, prompting the hulk to transform back into bruce banner. thor explains to banner, whose last memories are of sokovia during ultrons offensive, what has happened. banner, unable to believe hulk was able to remain in control for two years, doesnt want to transform again knowing that if he does he might remain the hulk forever. valkyrie meets up with loki and the two engage in a brief fight, and after loki learns where she comes from he uses his powers to make her remember her last encounter with hela. valkyrie has a change of heart and she decides to help thor return to asgard, and shows her good will by beating and chaining up loki. reuniting, thor and loki head down to steal a ship however loki attempts to betray thor to the grandmaster. thor, expecting such a move by loki, places the shocking device onto lokis back. thor tells his brother hed hoped he would at least show some capacity for growth and even begin to change for the better, but now he understands loki will always be a trickster. he then leaves the shocking device turned on with the remote just out of reach.thor, banner and valkyrie steal the grandmasters party/orgy ship and, escaping the grandmasters clutches, leave through a passageway known as the devils anus. reaching asgard just as hela is about to destroy the remaining population who had attempted to escape through the bifrost bridge, thor engages her in a vicious battle but is still overpowered and loses an eye. feeling he is useless without his hammer, thor has a vision of odin who explains to his son that the hammer simply channeled his powers, reminding him he is the god of thunder. odin also tells him that asgard is not a place but its people and they can re-establish their society and culture anywhere. now realizing his full abilities, thor unleashes a massive lightning bolt repelling hela. as valkyrie and heimdall attempt to hold off helas army, loki unites with korg and other escaping fighters and procures a ship which he uses to evacuate the asgardians. banner also transforms back into hulk to fight off fenris. skurge, feeling guilt over having allied himself with hela, sacrifices himself to ensure the ship is able to escape.thor unites with valkyrie and loki knowing hela will soon be back as she is only growing stronger from asgards power. thor suddenly realizes that he cannot stop ragnarok but must instead bring it about to defeat hela, and sends loki down to the vaults to throw surturs skull into the eternal flame. loki does so and escapes (its also heavily implied that he takes the chance to steal the tessaract) just as surtur is resurrected and starts laying waste to the kingdom. hela mounts an offense but it is little use -- surtur is too powerful and destroys her with his sword. thor escapes with loki, hulk, heimdall, valkyrie, korg and the surviving civilians/prisoners just before asgard is completely decimated. although thor is upset about the destruction of his home, he knows it was necessary to prevent the extinction of his people. he then finally meets his destiny and takes the throne (the captains chair on the bridge) where his first order is to return to earth.mid-credits scene:loki worries over thors decision to return to earth knowing he wont be very welcome there since on his last visit he tried to take over the planet. thor assures his brother he feels everything will be fine, just as a menacing ship that dwarfs their own appears through the window.post-credits scene:the grandmaster, who had been chasing thor, crashes on the garbage planet where he is confronted by the scavengers who are also a bunch of former slaves. he congratulates them on their revolt and agrees to call it a tie.\"][centuries ago, as five african tribes war over a meteorite made up of the alien metal vibranium, a warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities. becoming the first \"black panther\", he unites four of the five tribes and forms the nation of wakanda. as time passes, the wakandans use the vibranium to develop highly-advanced technology while simultaneously isolating themselves from the rest of the world and posing as a third world country.while working undercover in oakland, california in the late 20th century, prince njobu becomes convinced that wakandas isolationist policies have done more harm than good and vows to share its technology with people of african descent around the world in order to help them conquer their oppressors. njobu enlists black-market arms dealer ulysses klaue to infiltrate wakanda and remove a cache of vibranium.in 1992, king tchaka learns of his brothers actions. he confronts njobu, who becomes angry and threatens to kill tchakas loyal friend, zuri. tchaka reluctantly kills njobu to save zuri, and abandons njobus son erik in order to prevent the wakandan people from learning the truth.in the present day, following tchakas death at the hands of helmut zemo, disguised as a masked james barnes, his son tchalla returns to wakanda to assume the throne. after working with okoye, the leader of the all-female fighting force the dora milaje, to extract his ex-lover nakia from an undercover assignment in nigerias sambisa forest, he reunites with his mother queen ramonda and younger sister princess shuri, the nations current technological genius. at his kingship ceremony he is challenged for the crown by mbaku, the leader of the fifth tribe, the mountain-dwelling jabari. the two engage in ritual combat, with tchalla emerging victorious and becoming the new king. he lets mbaku live.in london, a gang led by klaue and including an ex-u.s. black ops soldier, erik stevens a/k/a/ \"killmonger,\" steals an ancient wakandan vibranium axe from a museum. when the tribal elders receive word that klaue has resurfaced in south korea, tchallas friend wkabi, who lost his parents as a result of the dealers actions, urges the young monarch to bring him to justice. tchalla, okoye, and nakia plan to intercept klaue at an underground casino in busan, where he will be selling the axe to an unknown buyer. the plan, however, goes wrong when tchalla discovers the buyer is cia agent everett ross and klaue suspects the deal is a setup.the deal subsequently goes sour, and a car chase ensues that culminates in klaues apprehension. while in cia custody, however, klaue is rescued by killminger. ross is seriously injured saving nakia in the attack, and rather than pursue klaue, tchalla takes ross to wakanda where his sister shuri uses the nations advanced technology to save ross life.killmonger kills klaue and takes his body to wakanda as a token, revealing his identity as njobus son to the tribal elders and challenging tchalla for the throne. killmonger triumphs in ritual combat and hurls the defeated tchalla over a waterfall. after ingesting the heart-shaped herb to gain the powers of the black panther, killmonger enacts his fathers plan, preparing shipments of wakandan weapons to be distributed to wakandan operatives around the world. nakia, shuri, ross, and tchallas mother ramonda flee to seek the aid of the jabari and learn mbakus men have found and are caring for the comatose tchalla.healed by a heart-shaped herb brought by nakia, tchalla returns to wakanda and to renew his combat with killmonger for the throne, which was never officially concluded since tchalla never died or conceded. when killmonger refuses to cooperate, his claim to the throne is immediately invalidated and okoye and the dora milaje turn against him. however, killmonger who is now wearing a suit of black panther armor of his own resists with force along with the border tribe. while shuri, nakia, and jabari battle wkabi, ross, piloting a remote jet with shuris guidance, shoots down the planes carrying the weapons before they can leave the country. the battle goes poorly for tchallas side until mbaku and the jabari arrive to support him, thus turning the tide. tchalla and killmongers battle carries them into the heart of the vibranium mine, where sonic disruptors used in the transport of the metal incapacitate their vibranium armor. while killmongers body is briefly exposed, tchalla stabs his cousin. he takes killmonger to see the sunset of wakanda and offers to heal him. but killmonger states that he knows he will then be imprisoned and would rather die a free man. he pulls the dagger out of his chest and dies.with that victory, tchalla is officially restored to the throne, with mbaku granted a seat in the national tribal council to represent his tribe in recognition of his loyalty. rejecting the isolationism of past wakandan kings, tchalla establishes an embassy in the united states to be run by nakia and shuri. in a mid-credits scene, tchalla appears before the united nations to reveal wakandas true nature to the world. in a post-credits scene, shuri continues to help bucky barnes with his recuperation.][spoiler: thanos and his children - proxima midnight, ebony maw, corvus glaive and cull obsidian - have attacked the asgardian ship in search of the space stone, which is housed in the tesseract that loki had stolen before asgards destruction. with thanos already possessing the power stone after decimating xandar, thanos army swiftly defeats the asgardians. after a futile counter-attack from the hulk, loki offers the tesseract to thanos in exchange for thors life - only to be killed himself when thanos anticipates lokis attempt to betray and kill him. moments before glaive kills him, heimdall uses the power of the bifrost to send hulk to earth. thanos and his children then depart just as the ship self-destructs, leaving a mourning thor behind and stranded in space.hulk crash lands at the sanctum sanctorum and is reverted back to bruce banner, who informs stephen strange and wong about thanos impending arrival. strange and banner retrieve tony stark and brief him about the infinity stones and thanos. realizing they must find vision to protect the mind stone embedded in his head, stark realizes he must make contact with steve rogers to find vision, who has gone off the grid with wanda maximoff. just then, maw and obsidian arrive in new york to seize the time stone from strange, and stark, strange, wong and peter parker confront them. having been traumatized by his defeat at the hands of thanos, banner finds himself unable to transform into the hulk and help in the battle. maw incapacitates and captures strange; stark and parker pursue his spaceship off earth while wong stays behind to protect the sanctorum and banner contacts the rest of the avengers.in scotland, where wanda maximoff and vision have been hiding, the two are ambushed by midnight and glaive, but steve rogers, natasha romanoff and sam wilson fight them off. they decide to seek shelter in the avengers facility in upstate new york, where they meet james rhodes, who is once again mobile with bionic leg braces. vision proposes that maximoff destroy the stone in his forehead to keep thanos from retrieving it. wanda immediately refuses however rogers suggests that they travel to the one place that has the technology to safely remove the stone from vision without killing him: wakanda.thor is rescued by the guardians of the galaxy, who had picked up the asgardian ships distress call. thor guesses that thanos would next be after the reality stone, which is in the possession of the collector in knowhere, but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing thanos from the dwarven planet of nidavellir, where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. thor orders rocket with him to nidavellir, while peter quill, gamora, drax and mantis travel to knowhere. on the way there, gamora talks to quill, making him promise to kill her if the situation presents itself. quill reluctantly promises he will. in knowhere, thanos ambushes the guardians, having already retrieved the reality stone and created an illusion of an intact knowhere to trap them. he captures gamora after a crucial moment when gamora begs quill to kill her, using the space stone to escape. thanos reveals that he knows that gamora already knows the location of the soul stone after prying information from a tortured nebula. nebula escapes and signals the remaining guardians to meet her on titan, thanos home world. thanos and gamora travel to the planet of the soul stone, vormir, where the red skull, the stones keeper, informs him that retrieving the stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves. despite his reluctance, thanos tearfully throws gamora off a tall cliff to her death and is granted the soul stone.stark and parker rescue strange from maws torture chamber, and launch maw out of the ship, killing him. strange believes they should retreat to protect the time stone but stark disagrees; he believes they should take the fight to thanos instead of retreating like theyve done in the past. the three leave to confront thanos on titan, where they meet quill, drax and mantis and formulate a plan to remove thanos gauntlet. while discussing their tactics, strange uses the time stone to view alternate futures, telling them hed seen 14,000,605 of them, with only one where the avengers win. thanos teleports to titan, where, after a brief conversation with strange meant to distract him, the group engage thanos hand-to-hand and manage to subdue him. mantis is able to calm thanos while peter and tony attempt to pry the gauntlet from his arm. quill and nebula, who arrived on titan during the battle, deduce that gamora is dead; an enraged quill retaliates, hitting thanos and breaking the groups hold on him. thanos takes the gauntlet back and defeats the group, threatening to kill stark unless strange gives him the time stone. strange does so and tells tony theyve \"entered the end game.\" thanos adds the stone to his gauntlet and departs titan.thor, rocket and groot arrive at an abandoned and desolate nidavellir. thor is puzzled that the giant forge is inactive. the giant dwarf eitri tells them that thanos forced the dwarves to create his gauntlet; in return, thanos killed all the dwarves except for eitri. after laboring to reactivate the forge and reignite the neutron star that powers it, the four create stormbreaker, a battle axe that serves as thors new weapon and grants him the power of the bifrost. meanwhile, the avengers arrive in wakanda and task shuri with safely extracting the mind stone from vision. thanos outrider army arrives and begins attacking wakanda, and the avengers, alongside the united wakandan armies led by king tchalla, mount a defense against thanos forces. glaive infiltrates shuris lab and attacks vision. the outriders begin overwhelming the defending armies before thor, rocket and groot arrive to join the battle. the tide seems to be turning for the avengers, midnight, obsidian and glaive are killed, but thanos arrives for the mind stone. a tearful maximoff destroys the still-implanted mind stone in vision to prevent thanos from retrieving it, but thanos uses the time stone to reverse the event and pry out the mind stone from vision, killing him. thor attacks and drives stormbreaker into thanos chest, but thanos survives long enough to snap his fingers with the gauntlet. on a faraway world he finds gamora as a child. when he confirms that he achieved his goal, she asks him what it cost. his answer is \"everything.\" back on earth, thor looks on in horror as thanos, his gauntlet now battered from the effort, teleports away.thanos goal of eradicating half of all life in the universe comes to fruition as people begin disintegrating; bucky barnes, groot, peter parker, quill, dr strange, tchalla, sam wilson, drax, mantis and wanda maximoff all dissolve into ash. in wakanda, only rogers, thor, banner, romanoff, james rhodes, rocket, okoye and mbaku remain of the heroes. on titan, only nebula and stark are left alive. thanos awakens fully healed on another lush, green planet and serenely watches the sunset, smiling slightly, satisfied at having achieved his ultimate goal.in a post-credits scene, the earth is in chaos as people begin dissolving into ash; driverless cars crash on the street and a helicopter is seen crashing into a skyscraper and exploding. former s.h.i.e.l.d. director nick fury and deputy director maria hill witness the scene on the street before they dissolve themselves. before he vanishes, fury manages to send a final distress signal to captain marvel.][the film opens in 1987 as hank pym (michael douglas) and his wife janet van dyne (michelle pfeiffer) are set to go on a mission, leaving their young daughter hope (madeleine mcgraw) in the care of their housekeeper. as ant-man and the wasp, they shrink themselves to stop a soviet nuclear missile from detonating inside american territory. finding that they cant shrink small enough to slip between the steel plates, janet goes subatomic to drop the missile into the ocean, but it left her lost in the quantum realm, and she was presumed dead. however, after scott lang (paul rudd), as the new ant-man, went sub-atomic and managed to return to normal size, hank tells hope (now played by evangeline lilly) that there might be a way to bring janet back.in the present day, scott has been under house arrest after violating the sokovia accords by working with captain america in stuttgart, germany. he is spending his day with cassie (abby ryder fortson), who is visiting him for the day. scott has a whole area set up with the help of luis (michael pena) in his house for them to play in, including a slide that goes out the door. unfortunately, scotts foot breaks through the fence and therefore the perimeter, and the fbi pays him a visit. agent jimmy woo (randall park) leads the inspection to make sure scott isnt doing anything suspicious. scott explains that hes had to get creative to entertain cassie, including doing sleight-of-hand magic, which impresses woo. the fbi leaves, and cassie goes home with maggie (judy greer) and paxton (bobby cannavale).with only three days left under house arrest, scott does what he can to keep himself occupied. he takes a bath and then has a dream where he finds himself as janet playing hide and seek with a young hope. scott later gives hank a call, despite both he and hope not having spoken to him since his arrest. he tells hank about the dream he saw. hours later, scott is tranquilized by something flying in the room.scott wakes up to find hope driving him somewhere in a shrunken van. she lets him know that she took off his ankle bracelet and put it on the giant ant scott has living with him. they arrive at the lab where they show scott that they have created a tunnel to the quantum realm in the hopes of bringing janet back. after scott describes his dream in full detail, hank and hope deduce that he and janet are connected because of the time he spent in the quantum realm. they are missing a key electronic component to get the tunnel to work, so they head to meet with someone who possesses it. hank shrinks the lab and takes it with him. however, they dont realize they are being watched by a transparent figure.the three arrive at a restaurant where hope meets with sonny burch (walton goggins), a black market tech dealer, while scott and hank monitor the situation from inside the van. burch knows hope as \"susan\", but he has already figured out her identity by the time she arrives. burch refuses to give up the component that hope needs, so she appears to leave. burch and his goons start to walk out, but they are knocked around by hope in her wasp suit. scott is impressed to see that she has wings and blasters. she fights them in the restaurants kitchen and manages to enlarge a salt shaker to knock out one goon while also running across knives being thrown at her. as hope grabs the component, she is attacked by the figure from earlier, ghost (hannah john-kamen). she is able to phase through anything, which means hopes punches are useless against her. scott joins hope as ant-man in a new suit to help her, but ghost escapes and makes her way to the van and steals the lab from hank.scott brings hope and hank to hide at x-con, the security company run by luis, with dave (tip \"t.i.\" harris) and kurt (david dastmalchian) as his employees. there, they try to come up with a plan to get the lab back. hank figures that he has to reluctantly seek help from a former friend and partner of his, bill foster (laurence fishburne).ghost, whose real name is ava, goes to her home. she phases involuntarily and must sleep inside a special chamber to control it.scott, hope, and hank go in disguise to the university that bill teaches at. he maintains a grudge with hank over the work they did together decades earlier, project goliath, in which bill reached 21 feet. scott then sees woo and his fellow agents outside, thinking they know hes in there. before they go, bill tells them that they can locate the lab by modifying a defractor on one of the suits regulators. hank says they cant use the new ant-man suit because its a work-in-progress, so scott tells them they can find it in the older suit, which is in a trophy that cassie took to school for show-and-tell.scott and hope sneak into cassies school, but the regulator on scotts suit malfunctions, making him the size of a child. they get to cassies classroom and get the suit out of the trophy before they are spotted.the trio locate avas home and find the lab, but she knocks all three of them out and has them tied up. she reveals she is working with bill, who took her in as a child. her father, elihas starr (michael cerveris), had attempted an experiment to reach the quantum realm, but his own tunnel became unstable. his wife catherine (riann steele) tried to escape with young ava, but the little girl ran back for her father. the tunnel caused a huge explosion, killing elihas and catherine, but ava survived and her molecules destabilized, resulting in her uncontrolled phasing. she and bill now plan to use janets quantum energy to help turn ava normal, even if it might kill janet. hank fakes having a heart attack to get bill to grab a tin of altoids for his meds, which really contain hanks trained ants that grow to a large size and help free them, allowing the three to escape and take the lab back.after enlarging the lab, janet takes control of scotts mind, revealing to hope and hank a new algorithm that will help them stabilize the tunnel and enter the coordinates to locate her, but she warns them that they only have two hours before the quantum realm becomes so unstable they wont be able to reach her for another century.burch and his goons go to x-con and interrogate luis, dave, and kurt using a truth serum (though the villains insist thats not what it is). luis reveals that scott is with hope and hank in the woods where they set up the lab. ava appears after having heard this information, and she takes out the wheels on burchs van as she heads to find the heroes herself. burch then contacts the crooked fbi agent stoltz (sean kleier) and tells him where scott will be. stoltz tells woo, and luis quickly warns scott so that he can return home before he is caught escaping his house arrest. cassie is with him and says he could use a partner to help him, meaning herself, but scott says he has hope, which cassie thinks is also a good fit.hope and hank are caught by fbi agents once they shrink the lab. stoltz grabs it but he is knocked out by ava, who then takes the lab herself. scott uses the trained ants to help hope and hank break out of the fbi headquarters. the ants guide the three to the labs location, and luis joins them as backup. hank uses the giant ants to get bill out so that he can use his old suit to go into the quantum realm and find janet. the lab is shrunken again, and luis grabs it. scott, as ant-man, is attacked by ava, but he holds her off long enough for hope and luis to get away.scott flies away on a flying ant to meet up with hope and luis at the rendezvous point, but they are followed by burch and his men, as well as ava. hope shrinks and enlarges the van to literally throw the goons off, even enlarging a hello kitty pez dispenser to throw at one of them. scott grows to giant man to stop them, but as ava intervenes, hope becomes the wasp to fight her. burch takes the lab and runs to the docks where he boards a ship to get away. scott grows again to reach him and stop him to recover the lab. luis shows up in another car to meet with them, but scott gets light-headed from being so huge that he falls into the water. hope swims down to save him.in the quantum realm, hank nearly loses his signal, but he finally manages to locate janet at her coordinates, and they reunite with a kiss. meanwhile, the lab has returned to its normal size, and ava and bill are planning to get janets quantum energy. hank and janet start to return as ava and bill begin the process, which starts to drain janet. scott and hope show up and disable their machine, giving hank and janet enough time to come out of the quantum realm. hope reunites with her mother at last. janet then sees avas problem, and she puts her hands on ava to stabilize her and stop her phasing. everyone leaves as the heroes take the lab. bill wants to keep protecting ava, but she tells him they need to split up. outside the lab, dave and kurt help luis incapacitate burch and his goons before injecting them with truth serum as the cops arrive, leading to their arrest. burch and his goons admit to everything.woo thinks he knows scott is out on the streets as ant-man, but he goes to his home and finds scott there. scotts sentence is finally over, and he is a free man once more. the first thing he does is go see cassie.in the final scene, luis gets a new, wealthy client for his business to keep them from going under. hank brings janet to the beach where they set up a new house that he expands to its original size. scott shrinks himself, hope, and cassie in a car so they can use a laptop as a screen like a drive-in movie. they are then bothered by a large butterfly.mid-credits: hank and janet have set up the quantum tunnel in a van on a rooftop with hopes help so that scott can enter it. he obtains quantum energy to keep helping ava be stabilized. just as scott is ready to go back, the others fail to bring him back, and he doesnt hear anyone on the other end of the radio. back in the real world, hank, janet, and hope have all been turned to ash by thanos snapping his fingers (at the end of avengers: infinity war), leaving scott forever trapped in the quantum realm with no chance of getting back to earth.post-credits: most of san francisco appears to have felt the effects of the gauntlet; more than half of all life in the city and on earth and the entire universe is gone... except for the giant ant, who is still in scotts apartment playing on his drum-set.the final text reads \"ant-man and the wasp will return...?\"][in 1995, on the kree empires capital planet of hala, warrior and starforce member vers suffers from recurring nightmares involving an older woman. yon-rogg, her mentor and commander, warns her to control her abilities while the supreme intelligence, an organic artificial intelligence who acts as the ruler of the kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check.while working with official ronan the accuser to rescue an undercover spy, vers is abducted and subjected to a memory probe by a group of skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the kree empire is at war. vers escapes and, after leaving the skrulls ship in an escape pod, crash lands on earth. her presence attracts the attention of s.h.i.e.l.d. agents nick fury and phil coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a skrull attack. in the ensuing chase, vers recovers a crystal containing her memories and fury kills a skrull impersonating coulson. fury later meets and agrees to work with vers while skrull commander talos disguises himself as s.h.i.e.l.d. operative keller.using furys security clearance, vers learns she was a pilot who is presumed to have died six years earlier while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by scientist wendy lawson, who she recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. the two escape after \"keller\" confronts them, with lawsons cat goose stowing away, and pilot a small cargo jet to louisiana. a meeting with felllow pilot maria rambeau and her young daughter monica reveals vers real name is carol danvers.talos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. using the black-box recorder of lawsons crashed plane, danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down - and she now remembers yon-rogg killing lawson, as well as lawsons warning that the experimental engines energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands. vers shot it and was caught in an ensuing explosion, with her body absorbing the energy. yon-rogg brought the amnesiac \"vers\" - the remaining portion of \"danvers\" on her broken dog tag - to hala.talos explains the skrulls are simply refugees, and lawsons engine was to help them escape beyond kree reach. using coordinates lawson had given danvers, she, along with fury, monica, and goose - who for some reason terrifies talos - fly their skrull-modified cargo jet to a cloaked ship in orbit. there they find the source of the energy-cores power, the tesseract - and some skrull refugees, including talos mate and child. yon-roggs starforce, having tracked them, captures danvers and places her in vr before the supreme intelligence. enraged at being used, danvers fights back, and discovers that a kree implant that purportedly gave her kree powers was instead limiting them.accessing her full force, danvers escapes, gives the tesseract to fury for safekeeping, and battles the starforce to give rambeau time to fly herself, fury, and the skrulls to earth - along with goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the tesseract is placed. rambeau shoots down a pursuing minn-erva. danvers chases an escaping yon-rogg and discovers the extent of her powers, including flight. she singlehandedly destroys multiple ballistic missiles that ronan, called in by yon-rogg, has fired at earth, and forces ronans forces to retreat. on earth, danvers quickly defeats yon-rogg and sends him back to hala with a warning to the supreme intelligence.danvers agrees to help the skrulls find a new homeworld, giving fury a modified pager with which to contact her in an emergency. fury later drafts a proposal for an initiative, changing the name after finding a photo with danvers old call sign of \"avenger\".in a present-day mid-credits scene, danvers meets avengers steve rogers, natasha romanoff, bruce banner, and james rhodes, who were monitoring the pager fury had activated. in an end-credits flashback, goose coughs up the tesseract.][after thanos activates the completed infinity gauntlet, clint bartons family disintegrates, along with half of all life across the universe. nebula and tony stark are stranded in space following their defeat by thanos on titan, but are returned to earth by carol danvers and reunited with natasha romanoff, bruce banner, steve rogers, rocket, thor, and james rhodes. the team formulates a plan to steal the infinity stones back from thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had used the stones a second time to destroy them, preventing their further use. in anger, thor cuts off thanoss head.five years later, scott lang escapes from the quantum realm to discover that his daughter cassie is now a teenager and that hope van dyne, along with half of the population, has disappeared in the snap. rogers has been leading grief counseling sessions for survivors still struggling with the effects of the snap, while romanoff is tirelessly keeping watch over both earth and the rest of the universe with the help of rhodes, danvers, okoye, rocket, and nebula. lang goes to romanoff and rogers, and explains that while five years had passed for them, only five hours had passed for him in the quantum realm. the three go to stark, who is now raising a child with pepper potts, and explain their theory that the quantum realm can be used to go back in time and steal the infinity stones before thanos is able to collect them. stark initially rejects their proposal with concern about risking his family and the peace he has found, but after reflecting upon the loss of peter parker decides to test theoretical models that would work with langs quantum tunnel, eventually finding one that works.with stark now on board with the plan, the remaining avengers set out to reassemble their team. bruce banner has now embraced the hulk as a part of him, and has melded his own consciousness and the hulks together into one. romanoff, after hearing reports from rhodes of an assassin that operates with similar methods to barton, goes the japan to track him down. barton, consumed with grief after the loss of his family, has been operating under the mantle \"ronin\" while brutally massacring cartels and gangs in order to try and improve the world thats still left. after some convincing from natasha, he agrees to rejoin the team in order to try and bring his family back. banner and rocket go to the small town of new asgard, where valkyrie and the last survivors of asgard have settled. they there find thor, who has become overwhelmed by guilt over not killing thanos the first time, in wakanda. thor has become majorly overweight, his hair and beard are overgrown, and he spends his free time eating junk food, getting drunk, and playing fortnite with his friends korg and miek. thor begrudgingly agrees to return to the avengers after some convincing from rocket and banner.after testing the quantum time machine on barton, who confirms that it works, the avengers are reunited with a plan - banner, rogers, lang, and stark embark to retrieve the time, mind, and space stones during the battle of new york in 2012. banner goes to the sanctum sanctorum, where he is informed by the ancient one that taking the time stone from her time line would prevent stephen stranges future efforts to stop kaecilius from destroying the laws of nature. she eventually concedes the time stone to banner after he informs her that strange had given thanos the stone in his time line, implying strange had intended for a specific sequence of events to occur for thanos to be defeated. banner also promises the stones return to their proper time lines in order to prevent any ill effects. lang and stark attempt to steal the space stone after the avengers confiscate it from loki. lang gives starks past self a cardiac arrest by pulling a circuit in his artificial heart, while stark steals the briefcase housing the tesseract when nobody is looking. their plan is thwarted when stark drops the briefcase after he is accidentally hit by the hulk. loki then steals the space stone and uses it to escape custody. rogers succeeds in stealing the mind stone from undercover hydra agents, but stumbles across his past self, who mistakes him for a disguised loki. after defeating past-steve, rogers meets back up with stark and lang, who now must figure out another way to get the space stone without running out of the limited supply of pym particles that allow them to travel through the quantum realm. lang returns to the present with the mind stone while rogers and stark devise a plan to steal the space stone from a u.s. army installation in the 1970s, while stealing further vials of pym particles in order to make the journey back home. while there, rogers sights peggy carter and stark has an meaningful conversation with his father howard.rocket and thor travel to asgard to retrieve the reality stone before malekith uses it against the nine realms. while in asgard, thor is reminded that his mother, frigga, would die soon and has a chance encounter with her while rocket steals the reality stone from jane foster. the two return to earth after frigga counsels thor and he retrieves his hammer mjolnor, elated to discover that he is still worthy of it. nebula and rhodes travel to morag to steal the power stone before peter quill does. as rhodes returns to the present with the power stone, nebula malfunctions and remains on morag. with two consciousnesses operating on nebulas systems, thanos and ebony maw discover the presence of future nebula and go to kidnap her. nebula realizes what has happened and tries to warn the others, but is too late. thanos scans her memories and discovers the avengers plan, and sends the more loyal past nebula back to the present as a spy. barton and romanoff travel to vormir to retrieve the soul stone, though are conflicted when red skull, keeper of the soul stone, informs them that the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. the two fight over which will make the sacrifice, with romanoff ultimately taking the fall, while a distraught barton returns to earth with the soul stone.after everyone has returned to earth, stark, rocket, and banner set out to craft a gauntlet to wield the stones. banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet and bring back everyone that disappeared in thanoss snap, reasoning that he can withstand both the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the stones. he succeeds, though they are almost immediately attacked by thanos, who has been brought to earth by the impostor nebula, destroying the quantum portal in the process. thanos reduces the avengers headquarters to rubble, splitting the team up and causing the gauntlet to fall into bartons protection. the past nebula is killed by her future self as she attempts to take the infinity stones from barton, while rogers, thor, and stark confront thanos, who decides he will instead use the infinity stones to destroy the universe and create one in his vision. the three fight thanos one on one, with rogers confirming thors theory that he is worthy of wielding mjolnor, but are each bested by thanos. soon after thanos army lands on earth, tchalla appears before rogers, along with all of the avengers and other allies revived by banner, before launching an assault on thanos and his army. after a lengthy battle during which stark is reunited with parker and quill is reunited with past gamora, thanos wrestles with numerous avengers for the infinity stones. captain marvel reappears, taking out thanoss ship while fighting for control of the gauntlet. stark maneuvers the infinity stones from thanos hand to his own and uses them to turn thanos and his entire army into dust, triumphantly stating \"i am iron man.\" parker and potts console stark as he dies from overexposure to the stones.following the battle, the avengers hold a funeral for stark, whose original arc reactor is floated out on the lake next to his house. barton and wanda maximoff take solace in the fact that romanoff and vision, who did not return in the snap, would be proud of their victory over thanos. thor makes valkyrie the queen of asgard and joins the guardians of the galaxy in order to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership for the first time in his life. barton returns home to his family and parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend ned. meanwhile, rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the stones and thors hammer to their original time lines, but decides not to return to the present and to instead live the rest of his life in the past with carter. he appears before sam wilson and bucky barnes as an old man, and passes his shield and the mantle of captain america on to wilson. a brief flashback shows rogers and carter finally sharing the dance they never got to have in their living room, truly happy at last.]'"

Doctor Doom tries to convince the others that he should lead them but they refuse and side with Warlock instead. Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock take off to another location to start the plan. \\n</p><p>They meet with Quasar and Epoch who have gathered some of the most powerful entities in the universe. The Living Tribunal states that no cosmic crime is being committed and he will not aid them. Galactus objects to being lead by a mortal and even attempts to kill Warlock, but finally agrees to go along with the plan after the other cosmic beings join Warlock. The Watcheralso lets it be known that he will not participate.\\n</p><p>Adam Warlock and the Silver Surfer return to lead the attack. Warlock takes Wolverine and Hulk to the side and reminds them that they are important because the goal is to kill Thanos, and they will not hold back on him. \\n</p><p>Thanos can still not get Death to fall in love with him so to spite her he creates the object of his affection, Terraxia. He claims she will be the perfect match for him and he no longer needs Death, who leaves when this happens. Thanos pretends not to care but is clearly infuriated by her departure.\\n</p><p>Doctor Strangecasts a spell allowing everyone to breathe in space and uses the Eye of Agamatto to transport them to Thanos. Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock have plans of their own and do not join the fight, instead watching from afar. He explains that most of them will not survive Thanos\\' power and they are merely a diversion.<br />\\n<br />\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\\n<ul><li> Part of the Infinity Gauntlet event.\\n</li><li> This issue is reprinted in comics and books, see references for more info.<sup id=\"cite_ref-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-0\">[1]</a></sup>\\n</li></ul>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_Also\">See Also</span></h2>\\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/wiki/Special:CreateBlogPage/Infinity_Gauntlet_Vol_1_3\" title=\"Special:CreateBlogPage/Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1 3\">Write your own review of this comic!</a>\\n</li><li> <a href=\"/wiki/Special:Forum\" title=\"Special:Forum\">Discuss Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1 3 on the forums</a>\\n</li><li> <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Infinity_Gauntlet_Vol_1_3/Images\" title=\"Category:Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1 3/Images\">Images from Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1 3</a>\\n</li></ul>\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</span></h3>\\n<div style=\"font-size: 85%;\">\\n<ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-0\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-0\">\\xe2\\x86\\x91</a> <span class=\"reference-text\"> This issue is reprinted in the following comics/TPB\\'s:\\n<ul><li> <a class=\"new\" title=\"Infinity Gauntlet TPB Vol 1 1 (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvSW5maW5pdHlfR2F1bnRsZXRfVFBCX1ZvbF8xXzE/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x\"><i>Infinity Gauntlet TPB</i> #1</a></span>\\n</li></ul>\\n</li></ol></div>\\n<p><br />\\n</p>\\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\\n<hr />\\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; width: 670px;\">\\n\\n<tr valign=\"top\">\\n<td style=\"width: 35%; text-align:left;\"> <b>Like this?

       "'Featured Characters:Supporting Characters:Other Characters:Races and Species:Locations:Items:It began with the unforgettable: the Stamford Incident, an explosion that killed hundreds. The following debate, with the push for the Super-Hero Registration Act, blossomed into the unthinkable: an ideological conflict among the super heroes, polarised into two camps, around the anti-registration Captain America and the pro-registration Iron Man. Everyone else hoped it would just end. But it took another incident to incite the unspeakable...Captain America had led his team in a mission to liberate the political prisoners being held in Prison 42 in the Negative Zone. Due to spies, Iron Man had mustered his forces in an ambush, bolstering his super heroes with S.H.I.E.L.D. troops and conscripted villains. Meanwhile, Black Panther was hacking the prison\\'s computers, and discovered that the pro-reg forces had activate a self-destruct system, with Iron Man\\'s group supposed to teleport out at the last minute. However, Stark didn\\'t know about the activation of this system, and was informed by Maria Hill that Panther had been who activated the system under Captain America\\'s orders. Deactivating the teleportation device, Black Panther tried to shut down the bomb. Everyone in the prison, pro-reg and anti-reg, rushed to escape through the power of the hero Cloak, who dropped them all in midair in St. Louis.Unfortunately, Cloak could not shut off his powers fast enough to block out the explosion, which caused a beam of explosive energy to strike the ground in St. Louis, setting off a domino of explosions which toppled buildings, killed super heroes... and left millions dead.In the aftermath, the surviving heroes regrouped, each side blaming the other for the deaths, and neither willing to accept their part - since they were, after all, good people who fought bad people. Unable to accommodate compromise, they left the nation open to attacks. The Skrull Invasion. The Osborn Insurgency. But no force was able to face un-co-ordinated attacks from two sides at once, and eventually, the two sides were left to settle their differences, eventually splitting the nation down the middle. Everything to the East is now \"the Iron\", run by Iron Man, and everything to the West is \"The Blue\", run by Captain America. Differences in politics have caused people to pick one side over the other, with the split ossifying every year.The only place in the country that embraces both is a community in the ruins of St Louis, built on a bridge over a chasm between the two sides. It is the home of, among others, Miriam Sharpe, a woman who lost her child at Stamford, and who wants to bring peace. She has arranged a meeting between the two sides, and she is being interviewed. The interviewer points out that she is a polarizing figure, having received threats and been compared explicitly to anarchists and terrorists. Miriam responds that her motives are clear and she has hope.From the east comes President Tony Stark, backed by She-Hulk. From the west comes General Rogers, back by Peter Parker. Greetings are terse, but before going in, Stark offers a goodwill gesture: in his entourage is MJ Parker and her young daughter, and they have come to see Peter for as long as the talks go on.In the talks, Miriam is able to get the two men open up. Stark explains that the Iron, as the internationally-recognized government, has wealth and resources from trade with the outside world, where the Blue is regarded as a rogue state. However, his citizens are running out of space, while the Blue has twice the space but half the population. He proposes that the Blue shrink, giving his people more space, in exchange for which Stark will make trade concessions. Rogers dismisses the offer, which leads to the start of an old debate between the to men. Rogers accuses Stark of grabbing for power, while Stark says that Rogers is just a general now, defined by his war and reluctant to see it end. As Miriam Sharpe tries to bring peace, she is suddenly shot in the back by a sniper.Reacting first, Rogers calls Peter Parker to catch the shooter. Leaving his family, Parker finds a remote-controlled sniper rifle. As Miriam dies, Rogers realizes that from the angle of the shot, the shooter was most likely aiming at him. Stark denies the shooter is one of his, but it seems that the war is set to reignite, once again demanding that people pick a side...• The Civil War never ended. Welcome to the Warzone, where six years of non-stop battle between the forces of the Blue and the Iron have split the nation down its center, utterly transforming it. In a world of new alliances and strange enemies, President Tony Stark and General Steve Rogers meet to make one last attempt at peace.'"
